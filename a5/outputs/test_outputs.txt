You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can show you as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and leisure.
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell down somewhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as an epiphany.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Brilliant.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in middle school, in State, Ohio where I was the weird of the class.
The one that they'd hit every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing the teacher's room.
I did it in secret.

And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, the lady,``I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that adults never come to know us.
You could come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this please . ''
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We went to see, we laugh, we cried, and we realized that she needed to be  being wasted.
We found a place, we train it, and we take it and we get rid of their family, because it was necessary.
It's something that we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to meet as an adult came to meet me, it became a box box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was a lot of talk about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first iceberg.
I was amazed.
My heart fast fast, I was just trying to understand what was in front of me.
You guys around me, around the water, almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think that it was about a snowflake on another snow of snow year after year.
The iceberg is born when they get rid of the glaciers or break the ice bars.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to get together and they're clinging up to the end, whereas others can't afford more and fall in a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a iceberg, that are isolated and alone, largely as we see us as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a iceberg melts, I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts, a iceberg releases fresh fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I'm going to photograph these iceberg as if you're dealing with the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments, there are just like that, and you won't exist that way again.
It's not death when you melt; it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the iceberg that photograph is very young -- it's a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in Kentucky, Greenland.
It's very hard to actually get a pink iceberg.
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts to roll, the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is there.
This is a iceberg of Greenland, an average size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so you guys, the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each one of a little baby . Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want them to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about it, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the X's X chromosome joins the X chromosome of the egg.
They both press and start life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my activity, it tends to be two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training historian, and what I study in this case is the way people embrace anatomy -- to say, human bodies and animals, how they've considered body fluids, the idea of the body -- what they've thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is the activist, as a patient advocate or, as I say sometimes, impact of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with young twins, two people inside a same body.
I've been working with people with analysts; people much lower than the medium.
And I've worked with many cases of people with outliers, individuals whose physical psychology doesn't fit in conventional male schemes and females.
In general lines, we can call it an insufficient.
interdependence, many forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't plug in the form of male or female ordinary forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual                                                     the      the
And so, in the fetal life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual kind of receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of instability to the bushes.
So, there are high levels of testosterone, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops by following a typical female course.
When the baby is born, the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl . It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not to puberty, when it's growing and developing the breasts, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After making it tests, you realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that.
Women, like men, we have the body in the body called               .
They're on the back of the body.

Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman; it doesn't know their cosmic structure; I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the bushes.
We produce aliens, and we respond to whistleblowers.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the pollinators that the woman who was born with testicles that have the syndrome of interactivity to the bushes.
So sex is a complicated thing . It's not that the investors are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I received a call from a 19-year-old guy born and raised as they vary; he had novelty, and sexual relationships with her, he took a life as a boy, and he just discovered that he had ovaries and uterus.
It had an extreme way of a disease known as a                                  a frozen   a frozen   a frozen  a frozen .
It had the 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus, the underground glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were multiplied, their brain was exposed to the typical hormone  typically male.
I was born with a child . Nobody suspicious.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by internal menstruation, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of interdependence.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as protons, is to say, they have direct tissue wrapped in testicular tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many variations of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they're angry, or young people, or physicists, are being subjected to normal surgery is not so that we can get better physical health.
Many cases are perfectly healthy.
The reason that you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity; supposedly, being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
It's a terribly simplistic idea.
And when you're presented a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with category.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture in our culture.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The most precious case is last year with the South Week South American corridor; he put his sex on the International Games of Berlin.
A lot of journalists called to say,``What are you going to do to determine whether Casey semen is man or woman? ''
And I had to explain to journalists that there is no such exam.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't bring a wise line between men and women, or between men and international men and women and international women; it's us who we track that line.
So, what we have is a situation where the more advanced science is, the more we need to admit that these categories, that we thought were stable anatomical categories that are directly correlated with stable intergalactic categories -- are much more likely than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology allows.
As you see, we get into a rough terrain.
Look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we think about the fact of saying about them in just a few nucleotides?
And as we spread in science, we get more and more in an awkward area that we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we're probably getting are too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the environments in human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the fetus.
There are very bold discussions today -- not in public, but it's within medicine, and when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to get them with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if you moved you didn't get it yet.
If I stopped moving it.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to face the dilemma to really determine someone's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics, I'm progressive, leaving people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
To consider that these categories are much more unstable than we thought to me.
tense from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension, I've got to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Father parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sexist, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much by looking at that music,``170 ,"and not for music, which is totally passive.
That's why it happened in 1976 with the parents.
The founding parents were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and explains why.
What they rejected was an anatomy concept and replaced it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers, what our parents were rejected was the idea of monarchy . monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they got to the political power for the blood right of the grandfather to father and then the child and so on.
The parents were rejected and replaced by a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They filled the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the animal differences . That was a very radical thing.
And in part, they were doing it because they were part of a illustrated system that they were getting two things about.
It was getting democracy, and at the same time, science is born.
And it's very clear, if we look at the story of the Father parents, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were spreading out of supernatural explanations, and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power transmitted by a vague right.
They were moving into a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence, we were transmitting the idea of anatomy coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it like that, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happens years later?
And women succeeded.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the  the                       , and he said,``Am I not a woman? ''
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying,``I'm a man . ''
Again, people of color who led to an anatomical coincidence about the anatomy difference and again succeeded.
We see the same with the disability movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at coincidence, we need to start asking ourselves why we maintain certain divisions.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical divisions in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we should give them the anatomy.
I don't mean that five year-old children were allowed to have sexual relationships or marry.
There are some anatomic divisions that make sense, and I think we should maintain.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, we're going to go back to those two things at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 of 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, born in terms: was born on March 1.
For the only fact of having been born three months before Mary is attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- right to the sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all that not because he has a different biological age, but he was born later.
We found other speakers in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- but I haven't told you if it's X, in virtue of being considered a man now, it's passive of the mandatory puzzle that Mary doesn't worry about.
Mary, for its part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So you still persist anatomical categories that in many ways are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advances so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could crumble?
I don't want to go to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is escapes.
Where are we going?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude,``Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it . ''
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosomes, and that to marry a woman, we have to have chromosomes.
Now, in practice, they don't make a cosmic testing to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the sensitivity syndrome to the .
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech```` I Have  to  ,"offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people`` not the color of their skin, but in the content of their character ,"going beyond anatomy.
And I mean,``Yes, the idea seems very good . ''
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their character?
I want to point out as well that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to guarantee people right, because I have to admit that I know from some of the veterinarians that are probably deserve more the social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some lawyers that I know can make more informed, intelligent and mature decisions on their sexual relationships than people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the issue of the heart content?
It's very difficult.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic resonance.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America will continue to run this current of thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is sustainable to be killed, unless it's willing to be subjected to a sex change, in which case it allows him to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins and then separate them, and so to increase their fame.
But when the phone asked the reason for operation, it was a very risky operation, and I was told that in the other country, these kids would be very abused, and therefore I had to.
What he said,``Well, have you considered the political asylum instead of the surgical separation? ''
The United States provides enormous possibilities to people to be who are not forcing them to change for the good of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be like, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the mothers.
And I mean something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different anatomical types, in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in interdependence, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about the universal studies is that women, in average, not all, but in average tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if you think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in the graduate, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered feminist, as I was now making a strange plant.
\" Tell me what the feminism has of feminism . ''
And I thought,``It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with taking gender stereotypes, so there's no female in feminism . ''
But the more I've thought about his question, the more I have seemed like there's something female in feminism.
I mean, there might be something, in average, something different between the female brain and male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, if the parents were very reluctant to find the way to protect people in the part of the state, it's possible that, if I've invented more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy: think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect one, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family wants to go live and work, it has the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to receive them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they value much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily deliver the world tens, maybe hundreds, of new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just regulate them for apartment buildings.
Imagine half of the people who want to live in the apartments were the properties and the other half still would fail to achieve it.
You could try to increase the ability by making amplification in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you're going to face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the ailments and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those astronauts.
But you could go to a completely new place, build a completely new apartment building, always, and when the rules of that place actually facilitate the building rather than put it together.
So I proposed that governments create new areas of reform enough to contain cities and gave them a name: low cities.
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, Java and October were thinking about the Honduras Report challenge.
They knew that every year about 75,000 workers would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, Honduras went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Peter wolves spontaneously imposed with a platform in which it promises reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked October to be his chief of cabinet.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection, trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to its more essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and bother all of the current residents of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so many technologies as rules to progress, and usually the rules that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Java.
They called me.
They said,``Let's present this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December, we met in Miami, at a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, which, in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, October said,``Paul, maybe we could see the video of TEDTalks . ''
And the talk would describe in very simple terms that a low city is a place where you start with distant terrain, a status that specifies the rules that will be applied there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those rules.
So the President of Honduras called me, and he said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to advance.
He asked me to go to quiet and spoke again four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver.
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the drivers that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measured at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's over 100,000 hectares.
The whole world applauded.
The faces of the audience were very serious and attentive.
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said,``Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of TEDTalks.
I have this here in my computer . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the essential, that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away from the north.
And also new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Honduras government would need help of countries associated, they could benefit from the countries associated with them to be able to set up and make the rules of the status, so that everybody could trust that the status effectively becomes.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly after, on January 19th, they voted in Congress to send their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just passed through this painful crisis, the voting in Congress in the favor of this constitutional Amendment was 120 to one.
All the parties, all the factors in society, the backs.
To include in the Constitution, you have to get twice in Congress.
On February 17th, again, again in another voting, from 115 to one.
Immediately after the voting, from 21 to 24 of February, a  a  a  a 30 drug skeleton went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in South Korea; it's bigger than the Boston Center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get permission.
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this precisely, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that will allow the administrators to come, and it will be allowed to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the last instant court for this new court system.
There are urbanism and cities of cities who are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who want to install in America, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
There are 700 million people in the world who say they'd like to change immediately elsewhere.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to a job, and sometimes they're single mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in Honduras?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose among various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my adult friends asked me to say,``Thank you TED . ''
I'm Jesse, and this is my value.
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession, and that is, I live with the suits.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog, brought, colorful and different for each occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of thumb markets and secondhand stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my rate in the environment and in my wallet.
I come to know interesting people; usually my money goes to a good cause; my appearance is unique; and buy becomes my personal search for treasures.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be from my neck?
Am I going to like color?
Let's cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
I want to tell you what I'm packing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
underwear for a week is all I've put in my value.
I thought I would be able to find everything else that I want to use after coming here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks by TED in underwear, that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All the set, including the jacket, cost me 55, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Monday: color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be wrong, when you're wearing a brilliant red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is surviving.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you surrounded you right, you're not just going to understand you, you will also be applied.
Wednesday:  the child you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the drugs, or I remind you to their little seven years.
I like to smile and say,``Thank you . ''
Game: The trust is the key.
If you think you see you look good with something, it's almost secure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside, you can't look at it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth six words for you: golden glasses go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: developing a personal, unique style is a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people came to me this week just for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to go emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy, colorful and brilliant suit, if there's a little love in my heart and search.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So, if we use a scale to measure every hemisphere's attitude, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's completely intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some of these would get one of these extremes, but I think for most of the speakers in this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great attitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other other physical qualities, we need pretty much logical to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them, and then we see how they react, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
And certain intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, they developed it.
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always falls.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar, I taught you a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to pass them, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these little particles.
And when you play with your particles, you find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics theory.
At that point, you found the physics a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But they didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a particle.
But it didn't fit to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics overlap.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend a little bit . It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal.
What we see is a little piece of metal, with a form of cruelty and that I'm supposed to be supported in a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I went to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this craft with swimming swimming, which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap, but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them to bother you, or actually scared.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel partners of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that  and the wind that goes on on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this metal piece to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We turned out the lights, then we introduced a vacuum and we extracted the whole air, and then we cooled it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're only in the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly, I was vibrating . And the way I checked was like a breath in this way -- as a way that expands and contract.
And when you give it a smooth push, we could make it vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a vibrant thing and doesn't vibrate at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are sitting and at the same time those atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain instances when those are aligned.
At the rest of the time they are displaced.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It's worth getting into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference onstage between one atom and that metal piece is sort of the same as the difference between that metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you also?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was reflected in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, and we saw that the metal followed there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep standard of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amanda.
And 18 months ago, I did another job on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories, I assure you, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories why we did.
I think my own story is simply explained in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It's a great education -- I didn't complain, but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
I better show you the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've taken from your launch.
So, just, we go to Georgetown.
Look around all the museums there.
There's the Afghan gallery, the MoMA, the   the   the   the   the   the   the                      the Van.
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, to metropolitan, the New York City art museum.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and, bam! We're inside the museum.
No matter where you're, Mumbai or Mexico, that really doesn't matter.
You move around and you divide.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We open the plane up, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
Keep forward . You're fun!
exploit.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,`` "    "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "  "
I see the sign.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there; I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the psychological technology.
So this image, for example, contains, I think, about 10 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me,``And what do you get 10 million pixels? ''
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can go around very simple ways.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wanted to delve.
So I started playing, and I found something that happened there.
And I said,``Wait a moment, this seems interesting . ''
I went in and discovered that children were actually playing something.
I spent a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metropolitan, and I actually discovered that this is a game called [unclear], which is to hit an ocean with a stick the Tuesday Tuesday.
And it was very popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper, and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to get away the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the paint.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to go back again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites,``The night star . ''
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the paintbrush?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
It's going to increase it and actually do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to cracks.
This is``The Night  ,"I think I've never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things more here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part . It's called collections.
All of you, absolutely all, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mansion, that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, I've created this function that I call``The Power of the zoo ,"-- we just just made a zoo around.
It's about``The ambassadors"in London National Gallery.
You can take things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you're going to contemplate these masterpieces.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes it justice to its artwork and that it's represented right online.
And the big question you ask me today is,``You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum? ''
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it . Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pixel, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm an Italian origin, all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the race of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It's just a while ago, if you wanted to win a formula from Formula 1, it took a budget, and it took it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you would win the career.
This is what, in engineering, is called a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two components: a sensor and a cliff.
Now what's interesting today is that real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered from networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer computers.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and affordable.
To recognize cities is big.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all these choices and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of paper in the MoMA year at MoMA during the summer.
It's called``" "  I . ''
Well, our objects, the environment, start to speak.
In a way, it's like almost all existing atoms become sensors and actuators.
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo sculpt the Moses, he says that at the end he took the hammer, and he threw it to the Moses -- you can still see a little table underneath and said to shouting,``Didn't you stand? ''
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples -- insist in the idea of capturing the environment and action.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully the 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember, played Italy and France, and at the end of the jitney,  the head.
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the Earth River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
In the early afternoon, there are people here, and there we do call, moving.
It starts the game: silence.
Gulf of France . Gulf of Italy.
Period; people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time . End of the regular time.
First time, second.
lesbian, and in a moment, the head.
win Italy, yes!
That night everybody went to celebrate it.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everybody went into the center at the meeting of the winner team and the first minister.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called``  the  , the  the , in the Roman time, people will celebrate; it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city's pulse in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another rapid example of detection: it's not about people, but of things that we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the process of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash on its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were laughing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that you can anyway.
Then we put a little chip, a tag, to the trash, and then we started to track it.
These are the results.
from Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of inefficient in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that you don't exist before.
complicated things are happening, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we cut doesn't disappear, that is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that you put a day, you're still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague at MIT, Isaac Berlin, could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in 1969.
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that they have a chaos and valves, sunglasses,      open and closed.
It creates like a water curtain, with water pixels.
If you fall the pixels, you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can pass, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the  Mayor .
I liked so much.
And it triggers a commission to design the building to the expo of the expo.
We call it the Digital Water pavilion.
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors and windows, but when you approach it, it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the shoes, you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said,``Give me the building . ''
No, it's not that they have it, but when it comes down almost all of the architecture disappears.
Here it is.
You see people intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am, trying to do not be able to test the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in 1969 came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me happen, but a building that kept making cuts and water holes, and you had to jump to not get wet.
( Noise of people) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use that people give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, the water pixels, and the projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with others in sync.
We could form this cloud.
Sort of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then that all of that could be a 3D pixels cloud in which you can get around, and go through, and see from very different angles.
This is the real controlled Flickr, going down to form a V, like before.
When you turn on the light, you see this . The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bell -- one of the best ballet dancers of today, the New York City star star star, to capture its 3D movements and use them as input for the flap.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, the capture in different resolution.
It's so much 3D digital in real time as motion capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels, we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible input for the flexible.
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- as a cloud of clouds like the grain error, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody hurt a little bit for a pixel.
And I think how remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and Obama's campaign is shown, we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engage to do this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up, like a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital signature at night, but the most important thing is that it's going to be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for one more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you'd like to be in better shape, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe it's those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
( Audience member: creativity -- creativity.
How many people choose creativity?
Let me get your hand . Let me see.
A few . It was probably due to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state?
A little less.
What about longevity?
Oh, most of them . That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something from this, the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been an issue here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you the gaze of a doctor on the subject.
The great graduation of the 20th century, TB .      in the Golden School Church, wrote a trial called``Nothing in biology makes sense except to the light of evolution . ''
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: Is it just about the past, or the future?
Do you mean to others or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at an extreme, is, of course, the one that interests us most.
We've got a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 25 different species of hominids.
Some of you have gone and go back.
We've been here about 130 years old.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Can you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that's used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin, but it's the same protein, emotionally indistinguishable, which comes out of pancreas.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry in the most bacteria that cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio David raises the authority, they think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, wet, it's very cozy.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can want no effort from their part.
It's really like a quick deal for bacteria with the occasional infrastructure of some force to the output.
But, by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future give us?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast inclusion of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief company, the animal kingdom, as a single and only company, and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I actually entered college, I had my first kind of biology.
It was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental: in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy in that cell are transmitted to the two child cells.
But when the multicellular organisms appear, things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something really important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the privacy of the body death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, sexually, sexually,  sex death; it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that happened, every time I had more doubt.
I came to understand George Burns's feelings, who still act in Vegas well in their 90s.
And one night somebody beat his hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of him, he finds a magnificent light dance.
And you look at it, and it says,``Come on for a sex soup . ''
\" Okay ,"George,``I choose the soup . ''
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution, not necessarily, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as a refugee rockets designed to send genetic charge to the next artificial level and then let the sea go.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen said when he said,``I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to make it not dying . ''
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and even the smartest.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria bacteria that can survive the heat of the mutations that will produce, if there were fish there, fish cooked in the vacuum, though, they've been able to make that a cozy environment.
So what does this mean, when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, the next phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first, we've been known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've confirmed our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to us.
And by the way, we migrated, we get up, and we get so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation required for evolution.
A second possibility is that you can produce a traditional, natural evolution of the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the gears of evolution are going down, but they are unexpected.
And in terms of isolation, when as a species, we collect distant planets, there are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive, intriguing, scary possibility.
The neural call, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what's elected at the individual and family level.
Think also that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their offspring, but in their own body to do the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
What if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's risk or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the app?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes?
If you look at the future, that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and demand 13 years.
It costs 2.5 million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a nearby cost to 20,000 and in a week.
It won't be a lot to be able to make the human genome true for $1,000 and become more and more at all.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe, or there's no experimental trial in course with the flu that's grown in cells from a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the tobacco?
That's real today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine two other little changes.
Can you change the cells of your bodies, but if you could change your offspring cells?
What if you could change the sperm and the volunteers, or change the fly recently fertilized, and give your kids a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the genome, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt hydrogen       -- a better memory.
Why don't I have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have a faster contact muscle that allowed us to run faster and more distant?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irresistible.
And when we're in conditions of happening this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before in neuroscience.
We're going to take a process that could normally be 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to be before.
Are we going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more intimate or more robust and more versatile?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the profound thing about all: Are we able to develop wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions wisely?
For good or for bad, and before what I could think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by making clarity, clarity.
clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity . Sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day . I was sitting on the dark.
It was the only one who could talk to flight assistant.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said,``No problem . We probably beat some birds . ''
The pilot had already looked at the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot wants the airplane to the Hudson River.
That's really not the route.
It turned out the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without noise.
And then three words said.
The three most missing words I've heard.
He said,``prepare for impact . ''
I didn't have to talk more with flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror . Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to, and I didn't, I did, all the things I wanted to repair, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that later, I came a phrase, which is,``collect bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to spend anything in life anymore.
And that urgency, that purpose, has actually changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while we were doing the George Washington Bridge, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big weigh.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give my ego.
And I regret the time that I wasted in things that don't matter with people who matter.
And I thought in my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a media on that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about wonders.
I'm not trying to be right; I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes down,``15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water.
I'm saying,``Please fly . ''
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we go down, I had the feeling of, ooh, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for this whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness is signed in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent, yet, and scream, cry, like a small one.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understand those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
On the top, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I'm given a miracle, not to die that day.
And I got another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and on.
You're flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how do you change?
What do you do, you're still expecting to do because you think they're going to live forever?
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents that can?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called PMTCT.
Tommy was one of the most important graffiti in the 1980s.
And one day he came home after running and said,``Daddy, I feel an ant in the legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today Twitter has a total paralysis.
It can only use the eyes.
His job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, SPECT, and his cause.
So I went and reunited with her brother and father and said,``Let's give them this money.
What are you going to do with it? ''
And his brother said,``I just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me . ''
And I said,``A second, not that -- I saw Stephen Hawking is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices? ''
And he said,``No, unless you're somebody important and you have a very good insurance, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said,``Well, how do you communicate then? ''
Anyone to see the movie`` the  and the butterfly? ''
You communicate that way -- you're holding it with the finger.
I said,``That's archaic . How can it be? ''
So I was introduced with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead I signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to cover.
And I committed with her brother and his father there at that precise moment,``All right, this is the deal: Tony's going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their interior can't communicate . ''
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys called " graffiti Research Lab ,"which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer, you draw about that and record negative space.
So you go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that appear, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First of all, they start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations.
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization, and a lot of moving things from one side to another, we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine to be able to communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing; I call it yoga because when you talk to the guy, you get an email of it, and you say,``I don't mean it . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world, literally from all the corners of the planet to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage of the back, and these hackers and programmers and conservatives and entrepreneurs took control from the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and that when we came back, they'd take the frames out of the walls and in their place there would be graffiti.
But for two weeks we were programming, we went to the , my son was part, my dog was part, my dog also, and we created this.
It's called Edward,  , and you can see the description.
It's a couple of cheap sunglasses that we buy in the   the                     copper wire and things from Homer Depp and Radio Shack.
We took a PET camera, we open it up, we mounted on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- you build yourself; we published the code free, the software is low in a free form.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says``no . ''
There's no hospital that can say``no . ''
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to PMTCT room.
I love this picture because this is the other person's room, and that's its room.
There was all this black and tropical during the big opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the parking outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of her family and friends and imagine what was the feeling in parking.
The funny thing was that we had to switch in the parking, so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what he said,``This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and somebody finally came to rescue and pull me out of there so I could breathe . ''
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and faster.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were the guy,``Oh, this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweet something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what I end up close to the circle, is that in April of this year at the LHC in the  in the Los Angeles Center, there's going to be an exhibition called``Art in the streets . ''
And``Art in the streets"is going to have the best experts in the urban art,                                      ,  that's going to be there.
proteomics is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically, this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, make it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the writer wasn't possible at some point.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with eye recognition technology; I just recognize something, and I was associated with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do . If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years I've spent in generally very difficult situations, and at the same time, a little bit dangerous.
I went to jail -- hard.
I worked on a coal mine -- dangerous.
I filter in zones of war -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days by eating this -- fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been immersed in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to try and look at social issues in ways that come up with attractiveness, interesting, and, hopefully, to analyze them in a way that are seen and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands, and the sponsor wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a warning in Ecuador.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was following was the following thing:``The " ALS  NASA: My TEDTalk ,"which you have no idea what it is about, and according to content could explode it in the face, especially if I put it into ridicule to you or your company in doing it.
But said this, it's a very good media opportunity . ''
You know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So, even with that priest knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, from advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be prepared, nothing could anticipate, for something as hard or as dangerous as I would go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan : I want to make a film that deals with products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with products and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call``The largest movie ever sold . ''
What's going on in``The largest movie ever sold ,"is that it's all on the bottom down, from beginning to end, has images of brand, all the time -- from the autism that appears before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, lumber    "              the   the              the Stanford Center.
These people are going to be associated with the  to perpetual -- forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea . (Michael KA: It's a round ."That's? (MK: It's round .) (MK: It's redundant.
I'm a round dog . (MK: I just say it .) It was more emphasis.
It was``optimist . forever . ''
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we're holding all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we'll sell a shoe, and it becomes the coolest shoe you've used.
The most cool car you've ever led in``The largest movie ever sold ,"the best suit you've ever drunk, cut from``The largest movie ever sold . ''
JO: The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, make them fund the film? (MS: So, we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film, from beginning to end.
And I would love that CNN will help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
Guy: However, I don't know how responsive the people are going to be.
XL: You have a perspective -- I don't know if``angle"is very negative, but you know how it's going to repeat? (MS: No idea .) David Cohen: How much money needless to do this?
MS: One million and a half.
XL: Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see as a lot of joyful idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart radar: Most answers will be``no . ''
MS: But will it be hard to sell, for the film, or for being me?
JK: Both things.
MS :...it means you're not very optimistic.
So, do you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right . (MK: Okay .) Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah . (MK: That's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to treat.
MK: We have some places to go . (MS: Okay .) Turn off the camera.
MS: I thought,``Turn the camera"meant to have a conversation outside of microphone.
Turn out the camera means``We don't want to know anything about your movie . ''
MS: And so, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you want to have anything to do with this film.
I'm surprised.
They wanted to know nothing with this project.
And I was very impressed; I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the separate media stage is not the idea to tell that new, worthy vehicle that's going to take the message to the masses?
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a orange mistake, and that mistake was this.
No, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what represents this image.
See, when you're looking for  images of transparency, in Google, this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way to roll, Sergey Brin . No.
This was the problem: transparency, simulation or deception, easily detected or seen, easily understandable, which is characterized by visibility or information, especially in business practices -- being the last perhaps the biggest line perhaps the biggest line.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name, the president, the name, even the CEOs name.
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change something.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear -- like that weird bear that still keeps going.
It's unpredictable -- like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it risky?
I'm going to take a whole bowl of color in color.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling us that we wanted to tell this story, and said,``No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you're telling a story . ''
See, when I was a kid, my father caught me in some lie -- and there he's staring like, she said,``Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the real story . ''
As you see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency want to help you -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard   of many years, I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off the intermediary and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- -- I started to realize that when you start to engage with companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make large, huge, giant movies and others who make small films, independent, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies, giant, say the reason why their movies are so successful is due to the associated marks that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say,``Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies? ''
And the movie is called``The largest movie ever sold . ''
How are we going to look specifically at Bay in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my button, you'll see the Great Bang.
Any time during an interview with someone can say,``Are you right fresh for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there will offer you one of these fabulous weapons.
Both``  fluorescent fusion, like``Paradise winds ,"they're going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have both for man, like for women, solid, to powder, in bar, whatever.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a permanent look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Similar to the kind of little movies you said, we're rather a living brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, to remind people to be the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe to Bank?
Bang is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: superior technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the armpits.
Man: We talked about something bold, fresh.
I think``fresh"is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus``combat smell and sweat . ''
It keeps you fresh.
How do we stay fresh? With better freshness, more freshness, three times more fresh.
Things like those who get out the benefits.
MS: And that's a three-dimensional company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me, to the commons.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand?
Man: Mmm my brand?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: To revive the 80, the        a , unless it's a washing day.
MS: Okay, what is the Gertrude brand?
coordination: something unique . (MS: Just) Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have to be like a dark dolphin . ''
I really like dark colors, many gray gray and things.
I usually take accessories like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a classic ,``Mercedes Benz . ''
Man 2: The brand that I am, I'll call it a fluke.
Woman 2: Partly, in a part of yogurt, in part of the Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
I see toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I suppose that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the market.
Man 5: Marco   failure.
Is that something?
lawyer: I'm a lawyer.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we cannot all be a brand Tom, but I'm often stuck in the intersection of dark glands, and a fluke.
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the``brand personality . ''
And I found a company called Orange        in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Newton, February, Hallmark to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Audience: I brought the photos, right?
MS: Yeah . The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit of how you relate to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you live -- as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are organized and start in a place, and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is``This was the best day of my life . ''
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be.
I like different things.
I like weird things . I like weird things.
A: How much of the``why"-- what does that serve us?
What's the machine? What phase of work are you now?
Why is it important to reset? What does the red represent?
Tell me a little bit about that.
... a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you had?
There has no fear . What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: Oh! (A: Thank you .) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience . (MS: Great job .) A: Yeah . (MS: Thank you .) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
Lynn Zambia: The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complexity, in your brand personality, the brand Morgan   a  a .
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature to avoid the things that they're not sure; they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them up and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic, Apple.
And you can also see here to Target, Wii, Mini from Mini Cooper and Zimbabwe.
Now, there are a little bit of playful brands and conscious brands, those things that they've gone and come, but a social brand is quite powerful.
MS: A electoral brand . What is your brand?
If somebody asks you to describe your identity of brand, your brand personality, what would it be?
Are you an amazing attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you rather a descending attribute?
A little bit more calm, reserved, conservative?
The amazing attributes are like being a playful being, like the prince, contemporary, adventure, attractive or audacious, like Europe  , fast or agile, profane, dominant, magical or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you rather missing?
Are you conscious, sophisticated as 100,000?
Are you established, traditional, provider, protective? Do you relate to Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, reliable, safe, sacred, contemplative or wise, like the Dalai Lama or ID?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, descendants and descendants, which said``no ,"they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control on the end product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the neocortex, and we came to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for cinema.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned the open-air advertising.
Throughout the city for the last five years there are no fences, there are no posters, no volunteers, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing way in schools in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer, or where I've been more successful are those in which I've interact with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They took the intermediary, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you go? Did you succeed?
Well, since the movie went down at the Sundance Festival, we take a look.
According to Burroughs, the movie burst in January, and since then -- and this is not all we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed.
It's not on the line yet . It's not in Istanbul.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about, they're not going to be part.
I've always believed that if you risk, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, you're pushing them to failure.
I believe that when you train your employees on the risk of the risk, you're preparing your entire company to get reward.
I feel that what has to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give the fear to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
We open fear . We open the risk.
From one catch at the same time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to get to transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk``We opened the transparency"has been presented by my good friends of email who for $7,000 bought the rights of the name in Eve.
EM: It's going to become big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
ECX shows``We open transparency . ''
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in name of transparency, that exactly happened with those $7,000?
MS: It's an exciting question.
In my pocket, I have a head of the TED satellite organization, the Sapling Foundation, a $ a $ a $ a $ to my TED assistant for TED the next year.
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the Uber's enrich plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we can commit these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use Windows's software; they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop that's used by an engineer to make this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Stuxnet.
We started with a Windows installed.
The eye goes into the gray box, damage the centrifuge, and the nuclear nuclear program is delivered; it's a mission.
Is it easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on Stuxnet six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the Windows: the installed used multiple pain vulnerabilities.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stuxnet, and we saw what happened to this.
So, very strange things happened.
Stuxnet was behaving like a lab rat that he didn't like our cheese: the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It made no sense for me.
And after experiencing with different cheese tastes, I realized, and I thought, this is a directed attack.
It's completely directed . ''
The gut is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that place.
If no, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working in this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought,``We don't know what the goal is . ''
It could be, say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better we'll discover the goal soon.
So we extracted and download the code code, and we discovered that it was structured in two digital bombs: a small and big.
We also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You know all the points for which to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the installed of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old textile language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at first were called function of the system, because we know what they do.
We then were looking for temperatures and data structures, and we tried to relate to the real world, with objective potential with real world.
We need theories about destinations that we can pass or develop.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent savanna, it must be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been reported.
It's not a number of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of Bush and to the Natasha index plant.
So I said to my assistant,``Three a list of all the experts in centrifuge and power plants between our clients . ''
I called them, and I consulted them in an effort for getting their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital eye with the control of the robot.
The robot is that mobile part inside the centrifuge, that black object you see.
If you handle the speed of this robot, you can certainly burn it and even make the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and download in an effort in order to go back to the engineers of maintenance, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital eye looking at the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number 16 will come up in that code, can't be obvious.
I started to research scientific literature about how these celebrities are built in Natasha and found that they are structured in what's called a waterfall, and each waterfall contains 16 centrifuge.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the attack code?
It's almost identical.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So that there is no misunderstanding: it wasn't.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
We'd just end up in street alley, and we had to start back.
Yet, we found that both digital eyes went to one and same goal, but from different angles.
The small eye is taking a waterfall, and making the rotors and       , and the big eye communicates with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In sum, we're very confident that we've determined what the destination is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natasha.
We should not worry that other goals are achieved by Stuxnet.
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, they really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and you see the centrifuge.
What this thing does is intercept the values of the sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data are recorded by Stuxnet.
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security chamber feeds from video.
Is it cool.
The idea here is obviously not just to cut the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and more aggressive.
The idea is to bring a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the great steam turbines is passed from speed, you have to open up valve tubes in a milliseconds.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're engaged, then you can have bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the operators and the security system will notice it.
That scares.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this . This attack is generic.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centrifuge, with uranium engineering.
It could also work, for example, on an energy plant, or in a car factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have a kind of attack -- that will disseminate this load with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use conventional worms of worms to disseminate it.
It's more possible.
And if you do that, with what you're going to end up with, you're a massive destruction of destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph, it's been public in many sides that people assume that the Kosovo is the main entity behind this.
What is your opinion?
Ralph : OK, do you really want to hear this?
Yes . OK.
My view is that the Kosovo is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is the cyber superpower.
There's one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately.
Because, otherwise, our problems would be even bigger.
CA: Thank you for holding . Thank you, Ralph.
Now, I want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and give  that you can give  , and another one that makes users of wheelchair up and go back to walk.
In``Berkeley Big"called these robots, exoskeletons.
They're nothing different from something that's put in the morning, gives you a great force, that you also increase your speed, and help you, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other things.
This is not a real idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier that, in average, has to take on its back, a 45 pounds charge, and it's being demanded to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions on the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
So, let me introduce you to
Soldiers: With the Hubble exoskeleton, I can put 90 pounds through variables for a lot of hours.
Their design flexible, it allows you to put it into the boxes and execute movements with great agility.
What I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increase my strength and my resistance.
Ethan Ben: We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new exoskeleton, this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
We're going to go back now to the users of wheelchair, which I feel particularly passionate.
There are 68 million people, in the wheelchair, around the world.
One percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the spinal column that when you start their life -- at the age of 20 , 30 or 40, they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that I get older quickly.
Its only choice, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from its successful emergence, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the lunch that Amanda  using Amanda , who 19 years ago, had a injury in the spinal column, and as a result, it couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Rothblatt: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our lunch, which I mentioned.
It has a few sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the computer, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the engines in the chains, and in the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very natural gait.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom was paralyzed.
In a fraction of second, I lost all feelings and all the movement of the pelvis down.
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said,``Amanda, never walk back to walk . ''
That happened 19 years ago.
And so I stole to the last piece of hope of my self.
The technology technology since then, it's allowed me to learn to be able to be able to go down in ski, climbing rocks and even riding in hand bike.
But they've invented nothing that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and to all the users of wheelchair, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the baton, practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is something serious.
And no, it's not the festival of the American Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos from the jungles of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis in this way in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, terrifying types, the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence hasn't yet observed.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understood of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the frozen jungle, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the headline itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has spread for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting meat and deforestation makes you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter by hiding trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the apes``make love, not war ,"because they have frequent sex, promiscuous and bisexual to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because Bonobos' life is more than the Karl .
Bonobos, like humans, love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a child game.
For us, and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and foster tolerance.
With him we learn to trust, and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity diversity, connections of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots itself of laughter, dance and human rituals.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos in the wild.
First, it's a Bonobo style game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a chase.
Look what she's doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,``It's got it from the balls . ''
I just believe that in this case you love it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play as the testicles, and also how play requires trust and encourage trust -- and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is political.
The game is political, it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe the place where the wonder is reduced.
And I want you to see -- this is Furby, a young female, who is playing with water.
I think, as she, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, and then unexpected connections that we form are the real seeds of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world, more and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our comfort.
To adapt successfully to a world that changes we have to play.
But will we get to the maximum our game capacity?
The game is not frivolous.
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and ruthless.
When it looks the least appropriate play, it can be the moments in which the most urgent.
So, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not feeding poverty, I eat fires as a captain assistant in a volunteer body body.
And in our city, where the volunteers go to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race against the other volunteers to get to Captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was upset in a conversation with the property that certainly would be one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing out on the rain, under a umbrella, on the pajamas, on the wake, while his house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I just got before I came before I was, as I was, as I was, as I was, as I was, as the captain first, to the captain, and this was asked to go in and save the dog of home.
The dog! I was kind of jealous!
So there was a lawyer or a gesture of money that, for the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I walked into a call in a call to save a live being, just because I was earning for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an addition.
He said,``You know, I need to go between the house.
I need to go up, go through fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I went -- I went up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the dry firemen, which at the same high or less had finished the fire and went into the main room in search for a couple shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the staircase where I met my News and the gorgeous dog at the main door.
We took out of the house for the house of house where, as I expected, his treasure received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of home thanking the courageous effort shown to save their house.
The kindness that she saw about the other was that somebody had reached it even a couple of shoes.
So much in my calling in Robin Hood as in my voice as a volunteer fireman, I'm a witness witness of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also from grace and courage.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're to achieve, remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give you now.
They serve food in a dining meal, clean up a neighborhood park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you train the game; you save shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1885 with a very simple idea: cement modules from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They allowed us to build bigger things that we, like buildings or bridges, one brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to LIGO, this happened.
It was called the automatic assembly brick.
And in a few years, the LIGO bricks came to all households.
It's estimated that they've been made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LIGO made it accessible.
LIGO simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks, each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits, one brick at the same time.
But there's a main difference: the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept that, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing pretzels.
I'm going to show you how it works.
Metrics are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're redesigned to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the output, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with a green green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle, and so we have a regulators.
If we change the button by a pulse module, which is here, and now we have an intermediate light.
We added this timbre to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, LOLcats are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and fix, Alice allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To get faster or slower, you just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind tags is it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to be reduced to use.
Lucas, sound, solar panels, engines; everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that doesn't learn in schools.
For example, how a night of night works, or why the door of a elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also led stickers to design schools.
So, for example, designers with no experience in electronics start playing with lawyers like a material.
So here you can see, with bottles of paper and cocktail, we have Georgia creating ...
( Music sounds) A few weeks ago, we took the designers at Rhode Island Design School, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said,``Do something.
Here's an example of a project that they've done, an active  a movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a locust made of Play-Doh that's afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, lawyers became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So, Aristotle has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So ahead and invent.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the industry of solar technology.
And my little company seeks to engage with the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm . Wait for a moment.
You can give it a little bit in charge.
We can -- we can get better left the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, the time?
All right . Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to detect; we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called the Americas for America, and it would be like some Peace bodies.
We selected some members every year and we put them to work with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them to the wild world.
They made big applications; they worked with municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of the current technology.
You know Al.
A city of Boston City.
So here's how you look for a quote, but what you're really looking for is someone's clean when you get caught in the snow because you know that it's not very good for fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this very unique way?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of Korea for America.
They were there in February, and at that time, a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hydrants.
But one of the members called Erik Michael noticed something else: that citizens are cleaning with sticks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a hydrant.
You accept just when you snow.
When you do that, you put a name in this case.
If you don't, someone can robot.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 programmed applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it extends in a viral form.
An accountable of systems from the city of Honolulu, when you see this app, realized that it could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt tsunami.
It's very important that it's going to work these tsunami, but people laughed the batteries.
That's why I ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens drop out of tapirs.
And Chicago just launched it to make people record to clean up sidewalks.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without friction, and organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen normally.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that we did for normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court power of California, that the moment has cost two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is programmed in a couple of days and it becomes a viral form of warning to the government institution.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not like private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without restrictions, in a way open and generative.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of government that the new generation has, not as a problem of an acquired institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Code for America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't complain, they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row at the DSM -- and all of those other things that put us crazy, the government is essentially in Tim Orwell's words:``What we do together because we can just not . ''
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to recession it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change; government does.
And because the government ultimately goes from us -- remember that from``We, the people"? The way that I think it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government is to choose people to occupy charges.
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially.
This is the center of phone services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark 31 in America.
Scott took this call.
\" "  "   ,"at the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing . It started with animal control.
And finally he said,``Hey, you can open the door door, put a strong music and see if you go? ''
And it worked . So Scott.
But that was not the end of the arts.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app, web and mobile, called             .
We didn't program that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the New York University of Boston.
One day, this really happened, comes up with this one,``,  ,``  , "    "             . I don't know if it's dead . ''
How do I do that to take it out? ''
\" Citizen"dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In Citizen County, it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbor.
The next report said,``I went to the place, I found the garbage behind the house.
Zach? Yes . Live? Yes.
I went home . I went home.
Good night,  sweet.
Pretty simple.
This is great . It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology.
I talk about a platform for people to self-assemble and help others.
So, a citizen helped another, but the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political leader? Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the surface layer of 15 inches.
Underneath there is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps it to us that it belongs to us as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sensual.
If we want this institution to work, we have to make the bureaucracy sensual.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We need to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the Office movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed report of            the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the .
That's not political activism, it's bureaucratic activism.
And for those of us who have resisted the government, it is time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we're going to get to where we need to go without the institution that can act in behalf of everyone?
We can't grow government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to strengthen civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act mathematically, you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so that I, in the aftermath, I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk; they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem, you don't care a lot to make your voices hear.
They're using hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a hydrant, taking bad, getting a trash cube that has a file inside.
Of course, we could always clean those hydrants and many people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the citizenship.
So I want to ask everybody in the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, will we be a crowd of voices, or will we be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here are impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that would not otherwise have.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, whether it's charitable, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the right practice, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an American family dominated by a matriarch, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She started a lot of the records in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born at the  slavery in Virginia over 1840.
She was born about 18th and his experience with slavery, and he had the way he sees the world.
She was hard, but she was also loving.
When I was a little girl, I looked at it, and she gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then shake me.
One or two hours later, I came back to look at it, and I was like,``Brian, still feel my hug? ''
And if I said no, I would grab again, and if I said yes, I left in peace.
It had this human quality that made you want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the top 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was 8 nine years old, I went to the room, and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
So he looked at it and she smiles, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, grabbed my hand and said,``You see Brian . The two we're going to talk about . ''
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said,``Brian, you'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody . ''
I said,``Okay, Mom . ''
She said,``Now I'm sure you won't do it ."I said,``Sure . ''
Then I felt, I looked at me and said,``I want you to know that I've been looking at you . ''
And I said,``I think you're special . ''
He said,``I think you can do what you want . ''
I will never forget it.
Then he said,``I just want you to promise me three things, Brian . ''
I said,``Oh sure, Mama . ''
And he said,``The first thing I want you to promise is you always want your mother . ''
He said,``She is my daughter, and you have to promise that I always take care of . ''
As I was looking at my mom, I said,``Yes, Mom, I'll do it . ''
And then he said,``The second thing I want you to promise is that you will always do the right thing as right as right . ''
I thought it, and I said,``Yes, Mom . I'll do it . ''
Then finally he said,``The third thing I want you to promise is you never drink alcohol . ''
I was nine, and I said,``Yes, Mom, I'll do it . ''
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother, a bigger year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, my brother came home with a six beers, I don't know where he pulled them, she grabbed me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We've just got to do the madness of always.
He took a beer sip, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said,``No, no, no . Okay . You follow, but I'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said,``Come on . Today . And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said,``No . I won't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said,``What happens? Take a beer . ''
I was looking at my gaze, and I went,``Oh, not you're still thinking about the conversation with breast . ''
I said,``But what are you talking about? ''
He said,``Mom tells all the grandchildren that are special . ''
I was getting away.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
This would spread widely.
But I'm 52, and I can admit that I've never taken an alcohol droplet.
I don't mean this thinking that it's a virtue; I say it for the power that identity has.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the ban.
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to them, we should commit.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million today.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in probation.
And this massive incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, it's so low, so despair, it's determined by these facts.
One in three black black and 30 is in prison or in parole freedom.
In urban communities around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all color young people are in jail or in parole freedom.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that is much better about if you're rich and guilty, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilt, but wealth.
And it seems like we feel very quiet.
Fear policy and force makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We're disconnected.
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you're growing on rights forever if you have a criminal condoms.
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of copyright loss will be as elevated as it was before they would pass the law from the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they're sentenced to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance to go out.
Right now we're in a process of some litigation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a sense, have been taught to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the crime crime?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think another way on how we're in our identity.
There's another way to look at it: it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but, if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
Out of every nine people executed, one that is innocent that it's unique and liberated from death row.
A rate of error, amazing -- an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation, it would never be allowed to kick airplanes if every nine to wake up, you would have to climb.
But somehow we isolate the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk to you about slavery.
I'm talking to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and it lasted to World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be lit.
They worried about being bombarded.
The threat threat was what their lives defined.
Now, there are older people who get close to me and say,``Mr. Stevenson, you say talks, make speeches . I give people to stop saying that in our history we first have with terrorism, after 9/11 . ''
They ask me to say,``No . I say we grew up with that . ''
The era of terrorism continued, obviously, with the segregation and decades of racial sweat and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we hit each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about race . I think it's because we're not willing to commit with a real and reconciliation process.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death penalty.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said,``You know it's good enough to listen to what you say . ''
Adam:``We have no death penalty in Germany.
We cannot naturally have it here . ''
The room stood in silence, and a lady said,``There is no way with our story, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately, we're going to have to execute people . ''
It reflects about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would execute people, especially if they were most Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, involved.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology . We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are shadowed by suffering, abuse, degradation, mortality.
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We finally talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the awake, the ones that will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that is inside our self.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are . Even though we're so rational, it's so committed to the intellectual.
With innovation, with creativity, development comes not only from brain ideas.
These things come from wild ideas also for heart convictions.
This connection of mind with heart is what propels us to look at not only the brilliant and     , but in the dark and the hard.
Malcolm  , the great little leader, talked about this.
He said,``When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression, we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will for being in the hopelessness and being witnesses . ''
Well, that orientation for spirit is practically in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should commit.
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's go back to them.
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer, to meet Rosa Park.
These women are just meeting to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. Carrie called me, to tell me,``Brian, comes up to the " Brian ,"we're going to meet to speak.
You want to come and listen? ''
I said,``Yes, ma'am . Yes . ''
So she said,``Well, what do you do when you come? ''
I said,``listen to them . ''
So I went and I just heard them.
It was something that was very vigorous, very lit.
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Park was headed to me and said,``Now, Brian, tell me that it's that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do . ''
And I started giving me my speech.
I said,``Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the feelings of life, without parole food for children.
We try to do something about death penalty.
We try to reduce the population in jails.
We try to end up with mass incarceration . ''
I gave all of my best speech, and when I finished me, I looked at me and said,``Hmm hmm hmm . ''
And he said,``You'll get exhausted, very exhausted . ''
And at that time, Mrs. Carrie came up, put my finger on the face and said,``That's why you have to be very, very brave . ''
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is superior to the worst we've ever committed.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a thief.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a murderer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts, the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very globalized, very exhilarating, it will not be judged by our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end of the character, the character of a society, not by the way they treat rich, powerful and privilege, but by the way they treat poor, the convicted, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I get tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been sentenced with a lot of hard.
I go to jail and I see my 13 and 14 years old, that they've been trained to be judged as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't?
The judge has it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late, thinking --``For God, if the judge can become something you're not, you should have magic powers.
Yes, Brian, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I began to work in a piece.
He had a 14-year-old customer, a little, poor, black.
I started working on the model, with a skull that said,``Look for my 14-year-old black client as a 75 year-old privilege, executive of a corporation . ''
At the point, I found that there had been an indication in the accident, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an active line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
Now, the next morning, I woke up thinking that insect, would be a dream, or did I actually write it?
To my horror, I didn't just have it, but I'd sent it to the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, I decided -- oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and I felt really overwhelmed, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and big.
I finally got off the car . I walked the judge.
I was going up the stairs when I found a larger black man; it was the consent of court.
When he saw me, she came up to me and said,``Who is you? ''
I said,``I'm a lawyer ."He said,``Is you a lawyer?"I said yes.
So I was approached and open.
And I whispered in the ear.
He said,``I'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was violence.
That was deeply connected with me, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said,``Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bear? ''
I said,``Yes, Mr. was me ."And we started discussing.
People started to come . They were all outraged.
I was the one who had written those madness.
They came up with cops, the assistant prosecutors, the authorities.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, all furious, because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye's bank, I got to see the thought I was going and coming.
I looked out the window and I went out to hear all that scream.
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern, entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table table table.
About 10 minutes later, Judge described a recession.
During the rest of the classroom, a classroom was offered because the thought had entered the room.
The assistant was moved on the old black.
And he said,``Jimmy, what do you do in the audience room? ''
And the old black stood up, looked at the assistant, looked at me and said,``I went into this audience room to tell this young man to keep his view on the target with firm . ''
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it's folding towards justice.
That we can't really be evolved humans if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is tied to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the relative, compassion and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view on the target with firm.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a check . What can we do?
BG: There are several opportunities close.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum this spring in which you're going to get an effort to reinforce the funds that are spent today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years . A billion dollars.
And despite this , 46 percent of the drug cases don't conclude on arrests.
56 percent of the rapes don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This referendum is going to propose these funds to make that law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in criminals in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest incarceration rate.
What would you tell those of you who believe that that is?
BG: Actually, the rate of criminals with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase emerges in the prison population.
And we stopped to convince the rhetoric rhetoric.
We have three legal causes to bring people to perpetual chains, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making those resources back to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brian, you've been excited today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED . Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, and they could just be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer to bring negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses, our senses get much more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing matters us to survive, the first stop of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called amygdala.
amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
ordered and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So a dozens of stories will be able to look at negative.
That old adage of the press:``If there's blood, sell ,"it's very true.
And since all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day, not to extract that we're pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think the world goes wrong.
But maybe it's not.
Perhaps, instead, what really happens is that we get distortion.
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, species extinction, water shortage and energy; we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good, we're very good at embracing problems, and at the long, we ended up with them.
We looked at what happened in the last century to see where we're going.
Over the last hundred years, the average life has more than doubled, the average income per capita adjusted per inflation has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy went from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think, today, in America, a lot of people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile, air conditioning and cars.
The   the  the  the  the  the  the last century, the employees on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
To support a lot of this is technology, and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that stops in information technology is in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how smooth it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and booming.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's graffiti in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, at Moore Law's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends in Autodesk call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics , 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and food, digital medicine,  Neanderthals and A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in Watson from IBM?
It was epic.
I found in the newspapers the best headline there would be.
And I loved this:``Watson beat humans . ''
Jeopardy is not an easy game.
It plays with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the cell.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and me, we launched a new university called Singularity University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to wash a company, or a product or a service, that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create luxury life for every single room on the planet; it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that, which is scarce and it's going to be plentiful.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon III in the mid-'70s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited to dinner the king of Swat.
Napoleon troops ate with silver covers, and the same Napoleon, with gold covers.
But King's king, ate with aluminum covers.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet; it's worth more than the gold and the plant.
That's why the tip of the monument to Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is  8.4 percent of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's tied by oxygen and silicon.
But then the electron came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was destructive.
We project this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is a thousand times more energy than we use in a year.
They reach the Earth 16 terabytes of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but of accident.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the one of the diesel for diesel : 1.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents a hour per hour compared to the 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have water abundance.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after Saturn happened?
It took a famous picture . What was it called?
\" A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yes , 95 percent is saltwater, the two percent is ice, and we fight for the 0.5 percent of the planet on the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 years, but right now.
The nanotechnology, the Neanderthals.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the birth -- I'd like to share with you, I was allowed to do this -- his technology called          the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of water in the day of any source that's saltwater, contaminated water, a latrine for less than two cents a gallon.
Coke's president just agreed to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have a full confidence to be, Coca-Cola will implement the world in 200 countries on the planet.
This is a powerful innovation by this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration from mobile phones in the developing world in the end of 2013.
Think of, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars,  , YouTube video, images, books of books and music, medical diagnostic technology now goes down and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when the applications are coming out.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Mall Foundation, which is called the X Machine Prize , 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the world's teams to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has A.I . can be coughing, you can extract blood blood.
To win, it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the death charge is 25 percent and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that I don't recognize, to call the health of health, and first of all, prevent the pandemic to happen.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion in augmented.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the seven billion brand.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, I'll go from two billion to five billion users from the Internet.
Three billion minds never before that global conversation are joining.
What would these people want?
What will you consume? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health, thanks to the Treasure, of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printed printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you bring us three million more members of humanity, healthy and productive health?
What about some voices never before?
What if we give the oppressed ones, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and can act for the first time?
What will these three billion to you?
What if they are contributions that we can't predict?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things -- things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Dolly.
It emerged at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supercomputers.
They've played with these college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people were joined and started to play.
And it has shown that today the recognition machinery of human pattern is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to assume the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the manuscript.
We have the capital of the computer.
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be used to work on the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The point of departure.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1885.
You may believe that it was a little bit, but it wasn't.
It actually gets fish.
And I described one of them as very``common . ''
It was the groupers.
It was a long time to the 1980s.
Now the fish is at the Red List of the IUCN.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and elsewhere, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're pristine.
The brochures still say they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the displacement of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by palm, and as you can see, some mangroves.
There were regulations of about 20 centimeters, black beard tilapia.
And the fishing of this tilapia was very abundant, and it happened for a good moment, so it was more than the middle of the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had halved half.
They Madison at five inches.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the introduction of arrest fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, I started in the 1960s, and I did a lot of developing projects.
Fish development knew to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen, imposing industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, was called the                     " The 4 . ''
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in the South China Sea, and especially at the Java Sea.
What we captured there was something invisible.
We captured, now, the sea fund.
90 percent of what we capture were sponges, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs on some remains, remains that are fish reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck, and then it was thrown.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a studio, and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a solid fund of soft coral, in this case, to be a logo.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them . They discovered them because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
It was still not drowned.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a zone where they've never caught.
But it doesn't have documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of departure, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this, something like that happens.
On the Y-axis, we have good things: biodiversity, amount of speakers, country's verb, water supply.
And that changes over time . It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the cause of changes.
And at the end of the end, I'm going to keep some miserable miserable.
And that, largely, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before extinct, is very frequent.
You don't lose plentiful animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous of big fish.
They become little frequent because we fish.
There are a few fish over time, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questioning that it was very different.
And you'll do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them present, like it captain such as, and so you see a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually don't use the scientists of fishing, because it's not``scientist . ''
So, we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with protected marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the point of departure has run, and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a marine area protected and can benefit from the vision that provides, which allows them to erase their point of departure.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle East people, for example?
I think the arts and cinema can maybe fill the vacuum . The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago there was gray whales in Chesapeake Bay , 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that nuances and tons are like``Avatar . ''
And if you think about``Avatar ,"if you think about why people get to film with the movie, they're talking about the story of people, why do you get to the pictures?
Because, in a sense, it has been lost.
So my recommendation, the only one to give, is to Cameron, to do``Avatar II"underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello . I'm Kevin Allende, the YouTube trends manager, and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we'll see why videos get viral and how important it has.
We all want to be stars: celebrities, singers, comedians -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper novelty in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a saint.
More than 48 hours of video video in YouTube.
And, of those, just a little percentage of it gets viral, it gets infinite from visit, and it gains cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators, participatory communities and surprise factor.
Well, let's start.
Ben " Oh, God, God . ''
Oh my God!
Wow!
Ahhhh, wow!
KA: Last year, Ben Vincent published this film filmed outside his house at the National Park in Yosemite.
In 2010 , 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the popularity rise of last summer.
Now, I'm not likely to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you call the Mountain Mountain Berlin.
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimmel.
Jimmy Kimmel published this tweet that would tie the video to popularity.
The creators of trends like Jimmy Kimmel presents us new and interesting things and give them a wider audience.
Rebecca Black: It's Friday, you've got to start the Friday, everybody wants to get the weekend, the weekend, Friday, Friday.
Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw about 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like``bow rainbow ,"this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other peaks, you're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday?
Well, I took you and so many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Homer Science Theater, was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But what is important is that a person or a group of trends to take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 members of`` Friday ,"in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was one paralyzed for each other day.
Unlike college entertainment in the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon by pointing or doing something new with that.
\" Norman Cat"is a repetitive animation with a music chord.
That's, that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three hours version that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the Internet Internet community.
There was remix.
Somebody made an ancient version.
And then it became international.
Suddenly a whole community of remixing that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all be part of.
Because today we're not just enjoying, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted``  "  "  "  "   ,"or Rebecca Black or``Think Cat"?
What would you have written that would have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video go up in a minute, only that really unique and unexpected can get rid of the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the cars in New York City, I admit that I'm not interested in too much.
Casey Nicole: I mean, I'm not circular for the circuitry, but there are often obstacles that prevent you to circular in the way that you're going to have.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and your humor, Casey City made that five million to see and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Now, let me : what does this mean?
Ahhhh.
KA: What does this mean?
trend creators, creative communities of participation, completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Bieber, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, they're barely the media of media, but to define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still armed.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning the job of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
Imagine it as the communities come into Titan, facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time, they're going to do it now.
It became the silence.
He died through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let it have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to push us, but we support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when you're going to be able to just drop down to the sea.
My mother, Masa, was just 18 when her father died, and a concentrated marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had resisted a task alone: the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her who couldn't do it.
And after a four year-old rate that defies fiction, a boat goes down to the sea disguised of fishing ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was pirate, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother took a jar with poison.
If we were caught, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, it's going to dip up in each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and I couldn't be able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finished the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same taste.
After three months in a refugee field, we locked in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set out in fusion, a class of class would work whose population is composed of immigrants.
Unlike the middle class suburbs, whose existence I knew, in fusion, had no sense of right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English were exchanged between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree on TED.
We were poor.
All the dollars were assigned, and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take, which was generally new clothes; it was always a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the other.
A school uniform to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
And there were both weird and painful singing on the``  ,"and some graffiti:``Asian, go home . ''
By home, where?
Something in me is hardened.
I was accumulating the determination and a voice that said,``I'm going to get you up . ''
My mother, my sister and I slept on the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered nightmares, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would start to be able to wake up.
She opened up a computer store, then he studied to be a stereo and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and infinite, and kids who are taken between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and sponsors.
And they created centers.
He lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, implemented with what I proved from myself.
In the other, he was buried in precise lives, tragically tortured by violence, abuse abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I was elected by the year Australia.
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So, so, I read the former resident of fusion, it was now so much, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to get back to the routine and to the comfort of life in a surgeon, a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, counting on each one and getting asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she went up to the boat.
The``no"ever been an option.
\" Make it ,"he said,``And don't be what you don't . ''
So I talked about juvenile descent and education and despair to the marginalized and the unprotected.
And the more frankly I talked, the more it was used to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they love, living in the frontier of the possible.
And although my bachelor ended up, I realized that I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly coming up, new on the scene -- and not just it's right, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside can easily mean collapse the horizons, it can easily mean accepting the presumption of your province.
I gave all the steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world gets sick, but not the way we fear.
possibilities that weren't allowed to be allowed to be tremendously encouraged.
There was an energy there, an implemented optimism, a rare mixture of humility and bravery.
So I followed my intuition.
He joined a little group of people for whom the slogan``can't do"was an irresistible challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, it was a giant wave of soup that we all share.
We worked on the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After one trip.
My hunch again.
Three months later, I had moved, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the confession was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother's raised.
At 17, it turned into a Mandarin whose mother beat it.
Without the support of his husband, he caused an epiphany to sue it and take the cause herself, and much more back to it when she won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was on the shower in a hotel in Sydney when she died, to 1,000 miles, in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to me.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in fusion and sat around their casket.
We told stories, and we make sure we were still with her.
At night, a monk came and told us that he had to close the coffin.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monk,``Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold? ''
\" Because you've taken your hand since the morning ,"he said.
\" You haven't saved it . ''
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life formed, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have easily picked up.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could wish that for right?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a little bit in their lives, getting brave on every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it, and see them safe, I would.
Thirty Neil, and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starry sky, with the Sufi                      Muhammad Ali.
We were talking about how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient Indian epidemic``The Mahabharata . ''
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel back to a car, we climbed the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when Archie, the great Prince warrior Indian, he had thirst, he took a bow and with a arrow on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with drill and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that machinery had replaced magic.
And that's very sad to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more chest.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a grasp if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't take it to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me her silver oil clock.
And this 50 year-old technology was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirate and     in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras that we have.
They pass our inspiration.
So I came up with this, threw this technological world to see how to use magic, instead of killing it.
books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and the touch.
The narrative becomes more and more nuanced.
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch Kyoto, an interactive application for iPad.
He says,``Get your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says,``This box belongs to...I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In many moments, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magician and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we opened from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became exciting.
So here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they lit your way into what I'm afraid of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated about a child was that a whole galaxy would know in a bag.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a bag that I drag to this magic device, inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every single book, there has always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, fake and guide for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it reveals.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary.
These are the slides here.
We've all heard of the fairies and the girls, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts, the costs?
These poor people have been trapped in the Indra cameras for millennia, in an old and humid book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary childhood story.
A story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And by talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been locked up, attached to their PCs, they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had lots of collections: sticks, stones, guitar and shells.
For some reason the kids don't do it anymore.
So to recover this ritual of childhood, you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tag it.
This is how a digital picture collection is created, and then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London put a picture of a stream and says,``Oh, I saw a fox today . ''
A child in India says,``Today I saw a monkey . ''
And this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we're planning to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on, and through augmented reality, you see a group of animated dreams that appear on the inside plants of the house.
At a point the screen is filled with leaves.
And you have to do the sound of wind and blow them up so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic and technology to another.
We take the energy out of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many school projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was to get to a listening director.
And not in a very scientific way, she reached a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and known: what happens?
\" How can we help it?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody, or maybe not everybody, but most of the projects in the school failed, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi culture . It's very simple.
It's got a  on a row, and it turns out.
Every morning, I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get at 95 kilograms.
But it's so simple, every time I connect, send my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him too . So, he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs heart assistance or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I'm connected to my Wi-Fi culture, and before I went up to my car, people start to speak,``Light, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chair and together to develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it will be available.
This little banjo connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will, from their house, take their blood pressure, send them to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and to be captains of their own boat, but it can also help us to health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of healthcare, the doubling of demand and other issues.
To make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have shipping control in cars.
Maybe we'll even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are in .
And also where all the gas are.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest TED to help this patient?
We asked, but no one knew.
Nobody knew where to get AIDS to save lives at this point.
So what we did was we did a        a  in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to: If you look at a  a  a  a  a , please send them, and when it's open, because sometimes they open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 Americans were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for East, augmented reality, to find these SETI.
And every time they're in the city of Marduk and someone collapse, they can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their Microsoft cell to find the nearest TED, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this, not just like SETI  , which is the name of the product, but also like   like         SETI.
And we want to start it globally.
We're considering all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, to work and act as a center for the  the  the  the DFS.
Every time you're on vacation and someone collapse, it can be a relatives or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also want to invite companies around the world that could help us value these SETI.
They could be messaging services or people of telephony, for example, to see if the SETI that is shown is still instead.
Please take on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is photography?
Because, of course, they're pictures that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15.
It mixed with my previous passion by drawing, but it was a little different because when you use the camera, the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the pulse.
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the pulse.
photos like this: a building in a very quiet road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite it, it keeps a level of realism.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common target of keeping the level of reality.
And when I say realistic I'm going to tell you.
Because of course, it's not something that I can capture, but I always want it to seem to be captured somehow as a photograph.
photos where you'll have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look real?
Is it the details or the colors?
Is the light?
What creates illusion?
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But ultimately it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic, but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginative objects, something that we can all relate to with the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional, as if there is.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So we beat the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It really consists to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic, I think it's those where we don't even think -- the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining pictures, it's very important to consider it, because otherwise something looks bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photo combination must have the same perspective.
Second, the combined photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two pictures, you know, with these requirements; they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect union.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is completely composed by pictures of different places.
I personally think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter, I knew that I had several months to plan, to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces.
For example, fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island so that it looks more substantial.
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it's going to be planning.
I always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you do a good job when you take pictures, the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start by showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it.
It's a diagram anybody who took from a folder.
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general aspect.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of the RISD microprocessor versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is this, like a lot of other people we tend to see, is sort of a straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents a magnitude order on the performance scale.
To talk about technology with secular curves is a novel thing.
This is odd here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
I would need more intensity because write about paper.
Why is that technology curves in logarithmic scales?
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve in which, say, this is the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to suck, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if I graph, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a remarkable curve would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this happens, it's a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology would move as fast as marketing, past tomorrow, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move into that pace.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to plant is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things will happen.
Or it's going to become a typical curve, I know like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's what can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
In the way, we're now in the middle of a transition.
On this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask, is, what is that new way that I adopt the world?
What new state does the world go?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember that the future happened in 2000 and people used to talk about what will happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has shrunk, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because it's all going to be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition could be that we experience.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So, we took about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that float around it.
If we look at the way that these chemicals are organized, we give a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA, and I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was some oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the blobs grew up.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms, those oil droplet.
But those blobs weren't alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a recipe of chemicals.
And every time they divide, they would have an unequal distribution of the chemicals that contain.
So every drop was a bit different.
In fact, the droplet that somehow would be differentiated to be better than the time of incorporating the surrounding chemicals; they grew more, they would get more chemicals and they divide more.
They generally lived longer, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In a way that we don't understand very well, these blobs learned to store information.
They learned to be information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked on this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to replicate.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living will be expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 white dust scanning that I try to hide the airport security people.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this DNA fragments and expanded it 10 to 22 times.
So if anybody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot for all of you, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If I was a ball, I'd put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step?
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another great interesting step happened in which things became very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, it evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and they were caught to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant resistance because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they set up a synergy.
So, they survive or failed together, whether a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community became more and more favorable for evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities got so much that, in fact, they went together and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have multicellular communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multitasking community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles, or the brain, and so on.
So, these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phones, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to abstract information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
It's the neural structures.
neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record, understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that point as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not to the evolutionary time period.
So, an organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit because it knew bad and sick the last time.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals that ate that fruit.
That's why the fact that the nervous system built those information structures greatly accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in the head.
I'm sitting here, and I'm sitting with a few groups, and hopefully building a similar, vague,  , in your heads that you have a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated, we turn it into sound, in sound sequence, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to perform abstractions.
Now we go through periods similar to multicellular organisms; we abstract our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, language invention was a little step in that direction.
The telephony, the computer, the video tape, the CD-ROM, etc . are the specialized mechanisms that we're now building to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger, faster and more able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
They already saw the evolutionary example of the  in which he produced a certain evolution with the program, to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales.
The first stages of the story that I told you about a billion years of each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next ones, the language, took less than a million years.
And the next ones, like electronics, seems just a few decades.
The process gets feedback; I suppose that     the right word to name something that speeds its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is feedback.
But I made life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I job to design them would be possible without recent computer advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know it does every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of Henry       , we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you could before, and it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes I want methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say,``Please computer, can you run 100 million sequences of instructions in random?
Could you run these sequences of instructions at random, execute all of those programs, and take those who are more approaching what we want to do? ''
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So, we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, was able to run two numbers in the right order.
And I said,``computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task?
We hold those and we remove the rest.
And now let's play the best ones in the numbers.
And we're going to play it back by following a process of analog to sex . ''
Let's take two programs, who are going to train kids, who swap underwater, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that were more successful.
And we say,``Please repeat the process . ''
It's warm again.
A few mutations.
And it tries again and it's repeated with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So, I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in complicated cases, in few hours.
Ultimately, we ended up with programs that ordered numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't say how it works.
I've tried to analyze them to see how it works.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they get the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on doing it.
And once I went in a 747 with Mark Minister and he pulled a card and says,``Look at this.
It says,``This airplane has hundreds of thousands of parts that work together to offer a safe flight ."Don't make you feel quiet? ''
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design process.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand from all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can execute these programs much faster.
I mean, it's feedback.
Things go faster and faster, and so I think it seems so confusing.
Because all these technologies get feedback.
We're taking off.
And we're at a very analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they become multicellular.
We're the amoeba, and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of whatever it is that comes.
But now it comes the lunch, and I think I'm going to stop here before I get rid of.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've exercise enough time to let me get part of my fake prestige on that.
Before I treat my talk, we talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about to get``breaking the rules"-- talk about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'll focus on one of them, and I hope many of you.
It's called the bat average.
And we talked about 300, from a bat that's 300.
That means that the   the  effectively, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being trapped, and that anyone who tries to launch it to the first base is not time, and the second base will be saved.
Three.
You know how you call a 300 back to the Great League?
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a 400 baseball bat?
By the way, that's somebody that 10 taps, it's four.
legendary -- like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Major League of baseball to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now we do this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you're available, and you're driven to a surgeon that has also a 400 of  in  in advance.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and one being wanted to have two ordinary coronary arteries and their family doctor is going to be a cardiologist whose record in angiogenesis is 200.
But, you know something?
She's improving this year.
And their actions have been 75.
This is not working.
But I ask you.
What do you think should be the average average of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, of a nurse or a   a  a  a  a  a  a ?
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the actions of a good surgeon, from a doctor or a  grass.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and it includes me, with the mandate of being perfect.
Never, ever, eat a mistake and pretend to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was in the medical school.
Now, I was a   a   a sympathetic student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood exam.
Such one.
I studied in my little box, in the nurses of the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
From my kind of anatomy, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the face, the diagnostic differential diagnostic and not usual.
And I even knew the diagnostic diagnosis about how to classify the kidney muscle.
And as so much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good; I graduated with honor.
And I quote from school school with the impression that if you memorize everything, then I'll know everything, or most possible, close to everything, because I'm going to be invited from errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met the dramatic lady.
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the dramatic lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At that point, I was assigned to the cardiology service.
And when you emerge, I was able to take a cardiologist to a cardiologist.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw the dramatic lady, I was playing.
I heard a devastating sound.
And when the auction was, I heard a broken sound on both sides, which would tell me a congestive heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops to work, and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it and I went to work in the treatment that I would give you.
I gave him aspirin and medication to relieve the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a little bit of dancers, water pills, so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that was when I made the first mistake; I sent her to his house.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone, and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consume it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I could have been able to take a whole information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility, that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When you send it back to your house, I didn't pay attention to a voice where I was saying,``Goldman, it's not a good idea . Don't do it . ''
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse to take care of Mrs. South,``Do you think it's okay if you go to your house? ''
And the nurse thought, and then he said,``Yes, I think I'm okay . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the passenger, they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad presence in the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I packaged to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking where my car was to go home . At the time I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not the one that's taken off of the dramatic lady before, but another one . I was told three words, those three words that most emergency physicians fear.
Other specialists as well, but there's a particle in emergency, and it's that we see the patient's patients.
The three words are: Do you remember?
\" Do you remember the patient that sent your house? ''
I asked the other nurse with total natural.
\" Well she came back ,"with the same voice tone.
She was right.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In the course of an hour of having arrived to his house, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called 911; the hackers brought it to emergency with an arbitrary pressure of 50 centimeters of hygiene, which means a severe shock.
I was just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff deploy all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise the blood pressure.
And they put an artificial breath.
I was shocked and rocked to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the stability was in intensive therapy and waiting against every hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days, it was evident to never wake up.
He had an irreversible brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they resisted what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let it go . The South , wife, mother and grandmother.
They say that they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I was punished by that and experienced for the first time the evil shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the parents and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The evil embarrassment of the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my boss; he was a charm.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I guess things and make sure that I wouldn't be allowed.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did send her home?
And in my worst moments, why did I commit such a stupid mistake?
Why did I choose medicine?
A little bit of that feeling was being digitized.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, the sky opened and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I'd better feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I was redefining the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was help in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and disturbing.
And he pointed here.
He looked at her throat, he was a little colored.
I put it up penicillin and sent it to his house.
But as he goes to the door, he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard change, my boss asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I pronounced the three words: Do you remember?
Do you remember the patient who saw for a pain in the throat?
Well, he came back and didn't have an academic failure.
It had a potentially deadly condition called                   election.
You can look for Google . It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top air, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He, fortunately, didn't fail.
You get antibiotics by the way, and you recovered the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and spare, then I was relieved and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same court of urgency, not a diagnosis.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because you're attached to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a radio X-ray, but it turned normal . A colleague that was looking at the patient had a certain sensitivity in the bottom right, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He had liquid order to resist and asked my colleague to review him.
You reviewed it, and when you noticed a certain sensitivity on the bottom right quadrant, I called the surgeon.
They both were operated and recovered.
But every case I was scared, I was leaving.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a position.
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
Just embarrassed and not support.
And here is the problem: if I can't release and talk about my errors, if I can't find the vote that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do you teach this to don't make the same mistakes?
If I go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party, I'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but not to listen to somebody to talk about their own errors.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a traffic in my hospital took the wrong leg, believe me that would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions: those who make errors and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that you cannot sleep and the ones that have a result of outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we move from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, just about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical practices and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Toronto to my program:``White Cook, Black Art . ''
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in every 10 prescription drugs in the hospital are wrong, or the disease is not right . In a system where antiretroviral infections are increasingly, more numerous, causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 channels by preventable medical errors.
The U.S. Institute Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about crude captioning, because we're not learning the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three years, and we don't act.
sleep deprivation invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, and it comes crazy with tears, and with alcohol to alcohol, and all of a sudden, my story is about contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars . They don't relate their symptoms always the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were taught, and we removed all the professional professionals in error, well, no one will stay.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their wildest cases?
In my program,```` White , black art ,"it's already a habit to say,``This is my worst mistake ."I would say to everybody, from skydiving to the chief of heart surgery,``This is my worst mistake ,"blah, blah, blah,``What are your mistakes?"And I'll run the
And their students would stop, they'll go back, they would go down and they bring out and start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to say,``Look, don't eat the same mistake . ''
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a refined medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The relative doctor is human, you know human, it accepts it, and it doesn't forget from its mistakes, but it's effort to learn from what happens to teach others.
I share your experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their errors.
It signals the errors of other people not with the intention of attracting them, but in a loving way and support for everyone to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they commit errors every once.
My name is Brian Gould.
I'm a redefined doctor.
I'm a human.
And I feel so much, but I strive to learn something that can convey others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take any day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that say to pick a middle American, it's about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research that followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers record the different tasks that are desperate by these executives and the time that they used to make related decisions with those tasks.
They found that, in average,         13 jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of mine.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the nine minutes, and how many of the hour?
How does the way that makes those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of today: choice to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and the potential solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, you get your hand up, just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your response is positive please give you a laptop.
And now my first question of the day: Are you ready to hear about the problem of choices.
Thank you.
Being graduate student at Stanford University, it came out with this very, very high level supermarket, at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
It was called Derek's.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar, more than 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of water water, and this was when we took water from the faucet.
I loved going to that store, but in one occasion I asked, why don't I buy anything?
This is the state of the olive oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were on the sealed box that came from milliseconds.
I once decided to visit the manager, and I asked him,``Does this strategy work right all these options? ''
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the twins.
Yeah.
They had 34 different kinds.
We installed a position to say, right to the entrance of the store.
We put out there to be killed from six tastes, or 24 different tastes, and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to try to test the miserable?
More people stopped when there were 24 -- 60 percent, that when there were only six , 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a little bit of a deserve.
Here we find the opposite effect.
The ones that were stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy.
The ones that stop when there were six, we saw that 30 percent of it bought.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy deserve if they found six.
Well, decide that we don't buy deserve, it's probably good, but it's good to conserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of choices of choices is affecting us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't make us.
Now the theme of the day: the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with guru, and I did that,                                , in which we looked at savings about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings for retirement savings, the 2015 program, wiped out to people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a correlation.
We had 65 plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the higher the number of funds were offered, there was less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 or more, not as high as you would like.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 60 percentile.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So, for those who decided to participate, the more people the number of choices were, the more people were encouraged by avoiding action or investment funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will recover to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that it makes the decision, that you take it even when this comes against self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and health.
They're more likely to choose less satisfying things, but it's obviously going better.
The main reason is that we choose to look at that giant variety of mass, mustard, vinegar and deserve, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare, contract and choose from that incredible exhibition.
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've tried, in a way or another, in different research, so that you can rehearse in your business.
The first is, cut.
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always upset when I say,``Court . ''
You care about losing space in the block.
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, you're going to get rid of strange redundant options, there will be an increase in sales, you'll go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When I went from 26 different types of Head and Shoots to 15, you saw an increase from 10 percent in sales.
When the coordination Gordon Cat eliminated the products for cats of cats that are sold, they increase the virtues in 87 percent, for two causes: greater sales and less cost.
You know that today's supermarkets, in average , 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is Alice and it provides only 1,400 products, a kind of tomato sauce sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle the choices better is David  David , the Harvard program.
All the employees in Harvard are automatically incorporated to a life insurance fund.
People who really want to choose, they're offered 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say,``I don't know how to cut.
They're all important options . ''
The first thing I do is ask employees,``Give me the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees cannot differentiate, you cannot do your customers . ''
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Gary.
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience, a few holidays with everything to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give a clapping if you're ready to take the face of Gary.
( A few applause) OK . Anybody who's ready to accept the offer.
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really get to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, that in the second, but I can go ahead and say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of choices, which is to concentrate.
So that people understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that consequences must feel very vivid, very concrete.
Why reason people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use cash?
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with                                                     the  in DNA, and these people were in a meeting where
At that meeting, that we created exactly as it was used, we did a little addition.
What we added was that we applied to the staff who would think of the positive things that happened in their lives if they save more money.
And with this minute, there was an increase in the 20 percent capitals of the 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts, four percent.
The third technique is classify.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the supermarkets, the  in the  the northeast of the northeast, the magazine exhibition can contain from 33 different kinds of different types to 360.
But, you know?
Because classification tells me how to differentiate them.
These are two jewelry exhibition.
One is called``Jack ,"and the other,``Snow . ''
If you think the one on the left is Shanghai and the one on the right is Jack, you give a laptop.
Well, there are some.
If you think the one on the left is Jack, and the one on the right is           , and the one on the right is Shanghai, give a laptop.
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Jack and the one on the right is Shanghai . But, you know something?
This classification scheme is completely useless.
categories must indicate something to choose, not that defines them.
You can often see this problem with those huge funds of funds.
supposedly, who are they informing?
My fourth category: Building complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase gradually complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision -- the buy of a car.
This is a German  of cars that allows you to completely embody it.
You have to take 60 decisions, to assemble the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
colors, outside color . I have 56 possibilities.
engine, for changes, four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that decisions appear.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options , 56 colors, a few, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at?
How involved are you.
If you're always acting the button button in every decision, this indicates you are overwhelmed, or you're losing them.
We found that those who go from a lot of options to a few options, they cut the button over and over again, and another one.
We lose them.
If you go from few options to many, you continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order that information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose.
Although choosing the change box doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner decoration, anyway, we're prepared to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
To summarize.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choices: cutting, eliminating strange alternatives; competition, making it real -- classify, we can manage more categories with less options; to drive complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage alternatives, or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for the people who serve.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to choose.
And the more careful we are in our elections better, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '80s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter of writing, you should record it to the government.
You had to record a text sheet of example with the machine.
And this for government could trace the origin of the texts.
If you found a writing with the wrong message, you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't think anybody could do this, how much it will limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some printed yellow dots on every page that makes them a pattern that makes them themselves and their printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to get a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can farm the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
There's the cybercriminals.
Like Mr. Dimitri World in the city of Kiev, in Ukraine.
The cell of the cybercriminals is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of online online, multiplied, who won money with their attacks.
This is Vladimir , from Tata, Estonia.
This is Alfred  .
This is Stephen Watt.
This is  " ,    "  . ''
These are Matthew Anderson, Tanzania Albert etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal media through banking trajectories to steal money from our bills when we buy online, or they steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in an infected computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this gentleman, Sam Jain, and this account had 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jain walked down; he knows his dog.
And I say today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a crime than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we observe today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have collapsed in the last 12 months, occupying a broken role in online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: the criminals that do it for money, the makers like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national states, the governments who attack.
And then we see cases like deciding.
That's a good example of government attacks against its own citizens.
To address is a certified authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
declared the last fall because of a sabotage.
They were holding the safety of the site and perpetuating a cartoon.
Last week asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people in the face of the attack.
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die to an attack of these?
It's a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What do the certificate serve?
Well, you need, if you have a website with rockets,  services, SETI, services like Gmail.
Except that you would intercept a foreign alternative authority.
And they're going to get appropriate certified.
And in the case, it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, the protesters held the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 and during the building of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this folder called "                                 "
And within that folder, there were notes from a company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large-scale communications in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, the Western governments provide totalitarian governments tools to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, the Indian script was found -- a trajectory used by the German government officers to research its own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a very good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intact.
But today it goes beyond.
The Internet connection is inspired.
They're going to use even tools like the Indian script to infect our computer with a trajectory to allow them to see all the communication, and listen online arguments, to get our data.
When we think about things in things like this, the obvious answer should be``Well, it looks bad, but I actually don't affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not arguing.
It's not a matter of privacy privacy.
It's about the freedom of control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we need today, to be forever.
Will we be blind in any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, at the South National Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi.
Nairobi National Park has no fence in the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like zebras migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning, we found it dead, because it was the only time we had.
My community, the morning, believe that we come from heaven with our animals and all the land to pass them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up hearing a lot of lions.
The dying are warriors that protect our community and livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for his father's cattle, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually this doesn't serve, because even helped the lions to see the stable stable.
I didn't quit . It continued.
A second idea was to use a carpenter.
I was trying to get the lions to believe that it was near the stable.
But lions are very smart . They came the first day and they saw the Spartans, and they went, but the second day, they came back and said,``This thing doesn't move, it's always here . So they went out and killed animals . ''
So one night I was walking around the stable with a torch, and that day the lions didn't come.
I found out that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I'll try and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken flashlight.
I took everything.
As you can see, the solar cell sucks the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little toilet box . I call it a transformation.
And the toilet box makes the lights flash.
As you can see, the bulbs go out, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is how lions see him when they come from night.
The lights dropped and deceive the lions so you think I'm walking through the stable, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, and she asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them . You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, leopards, and also being used to harvest elephants of the farm.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and awareness.
It even led to my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and teach them how to put them.
So, a year ago, I was just a child in the tracks of the savanna holding my father's cows, and I used to see airplanes flying, and he said he would someday be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to be engineer of aviation and pilot when it grows.
I used to hate lions, but now like my invention is saving the cows of my father and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
And so, the smell . What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship . Richard Turner: Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on your list?
TR: My next invention is -- I want to do an electrical fence . CA: An electrical fence?
TR: I know you've already invented the electric fences, but I want to do mine.
CA: You've tried it once, right, and you -- LT: I've tried it before, but because I got a wire . CA: On the foot of the cannon . Richard Turner, you're something big.
We're going to fit in every step that you know, friend of mine.
Thank you very much . utilitarian: Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called``Don't envy anything . ''
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim Il-Sung story, but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all changed.
When I was seven, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague.
He said,``When you read this, the five members of the family will stop existed in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're lying together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die . ''
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
The short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A living woman was dead on the street, holding a child climbing in his arms watching his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine runs to North Korea in the mid-'70s.
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also made more and more frequent energy cuts, all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Americas River, which serves of limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very anonymous at certain points, allowing North Koreans to be secretly crossing.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of famine, I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like North refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be reported to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became true, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and was interrogated in police station.
Somebody had been accused by being North, then they looked at my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer questions.
At the end of the interrogation, an official said to another,``This was a false report . She's not North . ''
And let me go . It was a miracle.
Some of the North Koreans are looking for asylum in foreign embassy.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and sports.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were so lucky.
Every year, countless North America are captured in China and deposited to North Korea, where they're tortured, jailed or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that the North people have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all its world can be used in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
And let me take you in South Korea was a much greater challenge than expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, and I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understand that there was a great gap between North and South.
We're all Koreans, but inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of division.
It even enters an identity crisis.
Am I surfing or North?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could call with pride.
Although adapting life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan . I started studying for the University of income to university.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I received a call alarm.
North Korea authorities were interacting with some money that sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside.
You had to push immediately.
So I started to plan how to help you escape.
The North people have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China, and I walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to guide them, in some ways, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in bus took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by an official of Chinese police.
He asked the identification of everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official approached my family, I stood up and I told him that they were ordinary people who were accompanying.
I looked at me suspicious, but fortunately I thought.
We made all the way up to the Lagos border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lagos.
But even after the border passed, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the border illegally.
After paying crutches and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of Lagos.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was held in prison to short distance from the South Korea Embassy.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or crutches.
I lost hope.
At that point, or a man's voice to ask,``What is the problem? ''
I was so surprised that a stranger would matter to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt, the man went to the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two Koreans and taking them out of prison.
I thank her all my heart, and I asked him,``Why do I help me? ''
\" I'm not helping you ,"he said.
\" I'm helping the North people . ''
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The  unknown set a new hope for me and for the North people when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But it's just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go up to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, work practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very lucky, I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Center:  shops, fast food, hot terrain.
So the planners in the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles South, as if this would fix what actually is wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South .  shops, fast food, hot terrain.
Just like 84 million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles South, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying from curious diseases in Los Angeles South Los Angeles.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than, say, Beverly Hill, who's about 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home, you see the effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see the wheelchair of wheels and sold as cars.
I see  centers of dialysis by    Starbucks.
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I was also tired of driving 45 minutes of late, and it's going to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, it was planted a food forest in front of my house.
In a patch of land that we call a gardening.
It's 45 feet away three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said,``Well, I can do what I'm coming in, because it's my responsibility, and I have to keep it . ''
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Green, we set up and started to plant our food forest, fruit trees, you know, nine whole vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group that's paid up by gardeners of all the processes, all over the city and completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and in summary, they gave me a criteria saying that I had to remove my garden, the prison was made by court.
And I said,``Let's go, really?
A judicial order to plant food in a piece of land that no one matters?'"So I was like,``Okay, let me . ''
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Leone, and I talked to the gang and one of Green Green members, who put a petition in Shanghai, with 900 signatures, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My shell even called to say that they were going down and looked at what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more hot terrain.
It's 60 miles away.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 125 million plants of tomato.
Why doesn't they look good?
Growing a plant will give you a thousand , 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of scissors will give you 75 dollars of results.
It's my anthem, when I tell people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Center.
I grew up there . I grew up my kids there.
I laughed to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me, and I'm going to manufacturing my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
gardening is my graffiti, I grew up my art.
As a graffiti artist, which stops walls, I reveal soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my entertainment of that canvas.
You would be surprised to see what the land can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You can just not imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how people affect.
What happened?
I'm witness how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You would be surprised to see how kids affect.
gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act that they can do, especially in a urine.
Also, they get strawberries.
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like            at night, and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very well.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me,``End, don't you have people to steal your food? ''
I say,``For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to steal . ''
That's what it is on the street.
That's what it is.
I want you to take it, but at the time, I want you to challenge your health . ''
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter in the middle of Los Angeles.
There were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was shared by their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, that was just for a moment.
So Green Green has reached maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, like about 50 people who come, work and participate, all in volunteer plan.
If kids grow tail, kids would eat tail.
If you grow tomatoes, you'll eat tomatoes, but if none of this is taught, if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and your body, you eat blind what you're in front of.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught . I see color guys who are in this path designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With gardening, I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are running from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington .
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is that you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to get people to work, to get kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become Egyptian ,                                                   angry gardens.
We have to change the script of what a spray is.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a selfish.
That the guards take their foot right?
That's his choice weapon.
In sum, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit -- to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your foot so that we can plant something.
Peace . Thank you.
Thank you.
( Crowd noises) You probably all agree with me when this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt, and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that comes out.
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars happen, that's not very pleasant.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make porous asphalt roads.
The porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so the whole rain water flow into the sides and have a road that's easy to drive, and not get water.
Noise will also disappear in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can get rid.
What is it going to get rid? You see, in this road, the stones on the surface are coming out.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and, etc., and then -- well, I won't do that . But you can damage your windshield, and you cannot be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bump with that.
Ah . It's ready.
Belshazzar, of course, can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage is in this material.
It's a porous asphalt, as I said, so it only has a little amount of  in between the stones.
Because of the intersection, to the ultraviolet light, to the oxytocin, this , this , this button, the glue, the glue between the acids, is going to pick up, and if you get mad, you're going to get microscopic and separated from the adapted.
So, if you drive on the road, you'll take the add, as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials.
If we can make this material available, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use steel wool, that to clean out, and we can cut the steel steel into very small pieces, and we can mix those little pieces with the button.
So we have a little bit of asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an insect machine.
The drive can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you've got to do is heat the steel, melt the button, the button flow through these microscope, and the stones will go back again to the surface.
Today, I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great driving machine here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to go out to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought,``Well, that's very interesting . We need to try it . ''
So we were donated by a piece of road , 400 meters from the ABC highway, where we had to make a trial lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there . You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage . That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of load on them, we repair them with our driving machine and we repair them and we would test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers, including these fibers, using the energy of insulin to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity of whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here . It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to face first before I can show you how it acts.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see . Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the lunch sound in my house.
My father was listening BBC News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally depressed.
\" The Taliban went,``The Taliban, I screamed my father.
I didn't know what meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
\" Now you can go to a real school ,"he said.
A morning that will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban was taken out of Afghanistan and made illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I saw me as a child to escort my older sister, who could no longer be alone, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could support where we were going.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that they seem to be shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us applied in a little room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we were arrested our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally, school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban suspected.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we following us?
They knew where we lived?
We were frightened, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was appreciated and daughters a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total character of a remote Afghanistan province, I insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so her father came to school.
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is her.
It's going to get back two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to not educate his children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said,``Yemeni, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money . You can force your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So do you want to not go on? ''
Today I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the pup, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud of graduating at  in                                           .
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was taken from his home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate her daughters.
He was not just playing from my college title, but that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I take him driving on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I sleep in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the 19th global ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why G cofounded, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families, like mine, advocate for them, to weigh and even in front of a daunting opposition.
As Ahmed . It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were coming from walking from solemn to his village, and literally, they escaped being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone, a voice warned that if you kept sending your daughter to school, you'll go back.
\" Look already, if you want ,"he said,``But I won't give the future of my daughter for his old and                   . ''
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeed, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling intersections of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school are in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of change.
I'm afraid that these changes don't last a lot, after the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, that they encourage them, I see a future promise and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hopeful hope and possibility, and every day the girls in G remember me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile,``daughter, resistant to Gaddafi . fought him.
But you're never going to get a  a Gaddafi style revolutionary . ''
And they've spent almost two years since it was the liberal revolution inspired by the surge of mass mobility so much of the Tunisian revolution as an Egyptian.
A forces with many other light citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the  Gaddafi regime.
And we did; it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the forefront, demanding the fall of regime, providing freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a scale to be able to find the  the Gaddafi's brutal brutal.
They've shown a huge sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and defeat the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy load, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of alternative.
For four decades, the Palestinian regime of Gaddafi destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of the liberal society.
The conscious of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with many other women, to rebuild the civil civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and right to democracy and national reconciliation.
There were about 200 organizations in Bangladesh during, and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Tasmania.
After a 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the platform of Women Living by Peace, a movement of women, leaders, of very diverse orientation, to advocate for the social autonomy of the woman and our rights right in the building of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the prefrontal period -- an environment that was more and more polarized, which is more and more polarized from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
The women won 17 percent of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, shortly, the context of elections and revolution as a whole, were disappearing; every day we found violence news.
One day we wake up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi graves.
Another day I loved the killing news of the American Embassy and attack to the clinic.
Another day we wake up with the news of the military officers of the army.
And every day, every day, we wake up with the government of the military and their continuing violations of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect from law.
Our society, formed by a revolutionary mindset, is polarized more, and it has gone away from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with our story of the success of the``Creative list"and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we as a nation, we choose bad decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
Did the list believe and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society, and that's where our society is still polarized and dominated with selfish policies of domination and exclusion, both by men like by women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than it needed elections, which only reinforce polarization and division.
Our nation needs the quantum representation of the female more than need to need natural and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call anger days.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse, which not only honor, but also put the mercy into practice instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion rather than exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that is about interconnection and alternative between female perspectives and male.
That's the real creative.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it.
According to a  from the Koran``Salaam"-- the peace --``is the word of the merciful God, [unclear]. ''
At the same time, the word``radio ,"which is known in all the Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word``radio"--`` -- --  -- simulate the feminine and material, which is going to go to the whole humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all people have gone.
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of the whole compassion, the whole existence.
That's how you say,``My mercy opens all things . ''
This is how you say,``My mercy prevents over my anger . ''
That everybody's given the grace of the mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing question, which has an equally disturbing answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that's all done: Why is she left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who owns him?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expertise in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story.
I was 22 years old . I just looked at the University of Harvard.
He had moved me to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the Seva magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green  American Express, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, I was looking at the head with a gun, loaded with bullets of arrowheads.
The man, which I loved more than anybody in this world, put a pistol in my head and threat to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of``crazy love ,"a psychological trap, of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm a license in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in Market Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the``Fortune 500"list, among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Bundy and The Washington Post.
I have almost 20 years of my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black laboratory, and my dog is a                        .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all levels of queens and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of malaria are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate, interdependent and long relationships, or, in other ways, in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find violence, reason why, the domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who paste him, and in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of violence than the victims of other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, bride and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, your warning signals or your patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night.
I was sitting next to me at the subway in New York and started to spell me with me.
He said two things.
The first was that he had just looked at me from a university at the University of the Lady and working in a very important bank in Wall Street.
But what struck me more on that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that it seemed like a child in the field.
I had some big models like apples, and a wheat urban hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that I did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it mostly at the beginning by putting on a pedestal.
We started coming out and I loved all of me: that it was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who put passion to help teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
I think I believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And that's why the license in that prestigious school and work in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to seduced and do the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is isolate.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave my dreams' work, but I thought I had to sacrifice for your partner, so I accepted, I left my job and Congo and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a crazy love, which was entering head in a physical, financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how she react.
And this is where they go into the scene, those stories.
As soon as we moved to New England, you know, that site where I was supposed to feel so safe was bought three stories.
One was in the car glove.
Another thing underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those stories because of the trauma that lived from small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those stories actually were a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already serious, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the truck.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's boyfriend out of my mother and married me.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved him, and he wanted too much.
And I was very, very lucky.
It just felt very overwhelmed by the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never get hurt.
It spent twice as much on our honey moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach, and he lost me, and he gave me so loud in the head that I'd bounced several times against the car window.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, got punched by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
Now, I was still thinking about one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers of Disease Control reported that every year 15 million children are killed , 15 million children.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So, coming back to my question: Why was I left?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, fell in love with a profoundly  , and it was the only person in the world that could help Congo face their demons.
The other question that everybody is doing is, why doesn't it just go?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone at any point.
This is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a juggler.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill it.
Over 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence happens after the victim has put the relationship to the relationship, after march, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent harassment, even after the abuse has become married, flood of financial resources, and manipulation of the court court system to terrorize the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not successfully with the man who taped their mother.
And yet we keep wondering why it's just not?
I was able to go, because of a last piece of paper that came my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, she would have killed me if he had allowed him.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world: to police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotype the victims as a spooky headlines, self-destructive women.
The question,``Why are you left? ''
For some people, it's a way to say,``The guilt is yours to stay ,"as if the victims are going to be able to get to love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published`` love ,"I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also escape, that they learned an unsustainable lesson from what happened to them, and they conducted their lives, joyful and happy lives as employees, wives and mothers, completely free life of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor.
I became married with a young and nice man, and we have those three children.
I have that black lab and also that magic.
What I'm not going to have to go back to you, ever more, is a hard pistol pointing my head in someone who says I want to.
At this point, the same time you're thinking,``Hey, that's fascinating!"or``Hey, how silly was you, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, which are being battered or that they were small or that are abused themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy particular love by making the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse thrive only on silence.
They have the power to end up with the domestic violence just throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the helmet to the light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers, their friends and family.
They rethink their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow up their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis that should be.
Thank you.
Hello . I'm called Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point, there's an awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed out . Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first light change on a TED stage, so you're very lucky to present it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when they came up, they don't have to tell me now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These patterns are very uncomfortable, less bad than I don't have to use them anymore.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so don't do anything as you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I would write the back, and the hair of the kid.
Of course, I saved with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that made me two days ago for work, there are very little days that we can do to transform our appearance, which, although surface and unchanging, has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my job sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing, but honestly.
The first question is, how do you get a model?
And I always say,``A hunter discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically hardwired to admire, we've also associated with it to high and high shape, to womanhood and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage, heritage that I've known to go on to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience, which is now shown skeptical, and maybe there are some lovers of the fashion they say -- wait . There is Namibia, Earth, Joan Simons, Lil  .
First of all, the happy to know so many models . It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at New York City said all and every one of the models in the past, and from the 37 hired models, only 27, is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people are always doing is: Can I be a model when it's older?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't get that.
But after, what I really would tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a  a nonprofit and poet surgeon, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my boss.
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the reduction chief of the American magazine, or the CEO of H & M, or the next Steven deserves.
To say, most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike heart surgery, it can be summed right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've done your studies, and you have a rsum and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you say, if you say you want to be president of the United States, but your rsum said,`` underwear for 10 years, people will look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos were shrinking.
And yes, it's virtually portrayed all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a bicycle, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a child.
It looks like my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a  in a  a few days before the photos for the French Revolution.
Here I am with my football team and the magazine V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They're creation of a group of professionals, chickens, hamburgers and photographers and statistics, and all their aid and  people and  and they're able to create this . That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is: Do you get free things?
I have too many 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple, but the privilege I get are the ones that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a driver, and it was a red symbol, and of course, you stop, and I was just sorry, and it's agent in order to keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for my way, not for what I am, and there are people paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I lived in New York, and last year, from the 14,000 teenagers that were stopped and recorded , 86 percent were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 17,000 black and Latino young people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me going to stop me?
But how many times I stand? And when?
By research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that number is raised at 78 percent at 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life from a model?
And I think the answer you hope is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and exciting.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative, resourceful and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask: with some more thin legs and hair, it will be happier?
They only have to get together with a group of models, because they have the thinner legs, the brightest hair and the clothes, the fashion, but it's probably the most physically insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the greatest benefits.
If there's something to retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
photography has been my passion since it was the biggest enough to take a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precious pictures, and I wasn't that who pulled them.
There were no artistic directors, no estimation, no opportunity to repeat photos, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took it tourists at random.
My story starts when, finding in New York City to give a position, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday . That's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me,``Why don't you get wise to New York on a kick trip and continue the ritual? ''
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of bringing the camera into a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied, and fortunately, no one has ever had the camera.
So, we weren't aware of how much life would change us.
It becomes something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new heroes, and I can see the life through his eyes and how it perceives and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly, it stopped in dry and pointed out a red catalog of the dolls that I was looking at small in previous visits.
And I described what had felt at five years of foot in that same place.
I started to remember his heart beating with force by seeing that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at New York are universities, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of engaging actively in conscious consciousness.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to go to somebody and ask yourself: Do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I want to tell you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The bubbles are in the most threatened bird group.
First, why do they have so bad press?
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as a message, silly, stupid, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the laughter of the laughter, the laughter, applause and regulations, these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan parliament, but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it . You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment . The parliamentary don't help prevent disease radiation.
You're far away . They're far away from extinct . And, my favorite, the bubbles have better presence . There are two types of bubbles on this planet.
There are the New World bubbles that are primarily found in America, like the computers and the coal, and the Old World bubbles, where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the bubbles important? First, they provide vital ecological services . Clean.
It's our natural garbage collection.
They clean the crows to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria . They help absorb the anthrax that not to be for them to extend and cause great losses of cattle and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no bus, the carcasses take three to four times more time in decompose, and this has huge branches in the spread of disease.
The bubbles also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient Egyptian culture.
Zealand was the symbol of the protest and the maternity, and along with the cobra, there was the unit between the East and the Netherlands.
In the Hindu mythology, Jonathan was the gross god, and he risked his life to save the  the 10th head of the 10 head.
In the Tibetan culture, a few very important skies on the open sky, in places like Tibet, there's no place to bury dead, or wood to create them, so these babies provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the babies?
We have eight species of bus in Kenya, which six are in extreme threatened extinction.
The reason is that they're being poisoned, and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna . The post-conflict communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the bubbles are victims of this.
In Southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bus are in the critical list of endangered endangered, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, it will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like the
This drug has been banned for veterinarians in India and have taken a position.
Because there's no bus, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in  in , and when you have street dogs, you have a huge time bomb for rage . The number of cases in Arabic has vastly increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa:                             ,  the  about Lake Turkana.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds . They cut them in half.
They are birds of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead bubbles to serve the boom and the petition market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're investigating these birds . We're putting them together.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so focus on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the bus, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that provide.
How can you help? It can become active, make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very including creatures, to give their time to spread the word . It will spread the word.
When you get out of this room, you'll be informed by the bus, but you're talking to your families, with your kids, with your neighbors on your neighbors.
They're very elegant . Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no spending of energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been molded for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1971, to 1977 . You see, I'm not . I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project that we set up in Africa.
And I was stuck.
I thought, at 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything we put in the world.
Our first project, which inspired my first book,`` from  "  from     "   "  from     , was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food . ''
So, we came with Italian seeds south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the    the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the  the  the  the  the  the , and we teach the local people to grow Italian and
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so we were paid to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go to work . We were amazed that local people, in so fertile, hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't farm anything, we just said,``Thank God we're here ,"`` Just in time to save the people in Zambia . ''
And of course, everything in Africa is beautifully grown.
We get these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy, a tomato will grow this size . In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe, we were telling the Neanderthals,``Look how easy agriculture is . ''
When the tomatoes were beautiful, mature and red, overnight at night, about 200 earthquake, about 200 earthquake, and they ate everything . And we said to the Arabs,``Oh my God, we  the  ,``Oh my God . ''
And the Americans said,``Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here ."`` Why didn't they say?"`` You never asked . ''
I thought that only us Italian errors in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what English did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hippopotamus.
You should see the waste -- you should see the waste that we give them to the people in Africa.
I want to read a book, and I read`` Death Death ,"of``"  Death ,"of`` Death . ''
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that that money has caused.
Just read your book.
part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners, we're imperfect,  colonialism microbes, and we treat people only in two ways: or the blobs, or we are pathogenic.
The two words come from the Latin root race, which means``father . ''
However, it means two different things.
Palestine, I treat any different culture like my kids,``I want you very much . ''
Parkinson, I treat everybody in a different culture like my servants.
That's why the white in Africa are called``black ,"boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face .``The small thing is beautiful ,"I wrote by      , in all economic development, if people don't want to be helped, placed alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respect.
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said,``Can you -- can you imagine a city that is not Newtonian? ''
I decided at the age of 27 only to respond to people, and I invented a system called         , where you never start anything, you've never started anything, but it becomes a servant of local passion, the local servant of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So, what do you do?
It comes to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of locality.
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe . We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge, because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: why not us, for once instead of coming to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, we listen to them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
Entrepreneurs never attend, and they'll never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they've identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which is no.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family's family doctor, the family's family doctor, which is established with you in your house, on your kitchen table, in coffee, and it helps you to find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making life.
I started this as a test in hope, city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this hot trash that we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on board, and the government came to me to ask,``How do you do that?
How can you do it?"And I said,``I did something very, very, very difficult.
I fell up and listened to them .'"So, the government says,``Don't again ."We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness.
Peter dramatic, one of the greatest corporate advisers in history, passed at 96 years ago.
Peter dramatic was a philosophy teacher before involved in business, and this is what Peter  says,``planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy . ''
planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you're going to rebuild Christchurch without knowing what the most astute people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer reliable, privacy, has to be fantastic to help you, and then you'll go on, you'll come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you introduce more this morning?
Local people . That's what you've been clapping.
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, which is not renewables, manufacturing -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The engine of internal combustion is not sustainable.
The brakes as a way of holding machinery is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we nurture, we cure, we educate, we transmit, we communicate, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There's no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent technology for green revolution? universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
There's an adorable story that I read in a future magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year 18th.
And in the year 1800, this group of people gathered, and specifically what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was unique: New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and pointed, if the population keeps growing this rate, to bring the population of New York to all around us, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already getting into manure . So, in 1800, they were doing this dirty technology that would run the life in New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in America, the United States appeared 100,000 auto companies , 100,000.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed, and there were very few, scarce, factories in space.
Darfur, Michigan . Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you've got to offer it.
Otherwise, you're not going to be talking to you.
Then you have to offer an absolute, dedicated, reverse service.
And, subsequently, you'll have to tell you the truth about it.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three wonderful things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing, and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
There's no.
This is still not born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie world,                                    ,  the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: no one was started by one person.
Never the word``me ,"but the word``us ,"32 times.
He wasn't only when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone . Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have factors, who come from a little business of small businesses sitting in coffee, in bars along their dedicated beds who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks to this epidemic, someone who's going to ask you, what do you need?
What can you do? You can do it?
Okay, can you sell? Can you look for money? ''
\" Oh, no, I can't do that ."`` I want you to look for somebody? ''
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those surrounded us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't have a lot of knowledge about sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like highways, templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their apartments?
How can we pay and ask for more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape better?
How do we share more of our hopes to empty shops so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadow to lovers, drunk and dreamer from centuries, and I trust in a city.
There's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with most of America's abandoned properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could become a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan, like a mother for me.
Their death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave clarity to the meaningful things of my life today.
But I'm going to be able to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let you go through the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with old old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned in a giant blackboard and painted on her phrases to complete:``Before I die, I want...''
So, they could take a chalk, reflect about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept covering.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
\" Before I die, I want to be judged by piracy ."`` Before I die I want to sit in the line of the change line . ''
\" Before I die I want to sing for millions of people . ''
\" Before I die, I want to plant a tree . ''
\" Before I die, I want to live outside the network . ''
\" Before I die, I want to hug it again . ''
\" Before I die I want to go to somebody's rescue . ''
\" Before I die I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space was constructive and dreams and hope of people made me laugh, they were missing, and they gave me comfort in hard moments.
It's about knowing that you're not alone . It's about understanding our neighbors in new new ways and molecular, and it's about giving up to reflection and contemplation, and to remember what's most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and they've now made walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of argument, it's more important than ever, to find ways of conserving perspective and remembering that life is short and delicate.
Death is something we often avoid to talk about, or even thinking, but I understand that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
Think of the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
Red is 22, it's high and very good-looking.
It doesn't speak, but they transmit better than some of the best speakers.
It knows what the love is.
It's completely shared by what happens.
It's not exciting . It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about religious differences and look at this: it has never lied.
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to test words that I could not even remember, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be unknown.
Samuel is 16 . It's high . It's very good-looking.
It's the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if my chocolate stole my chocolate, but remember the year when I came out each of my iPod songs, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I'd be able to pop in my arm during the first episode of Texas and the birthday of Lady Gaga.
Doesn't it look amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not adjusted to the concept of society, they're often ignored and understood.
But what led my heart and strength my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they won't consider them within the ordinary, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those least familiar with the term``autism ,"is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and times to physical skills.
In each individual, it manifest differently, from there that Yemen is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that's faster in the world, there's no cause or cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months passed, I realized that he was different.
I was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and queen in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars on the way around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would be between media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the nerds, frustration and hyperactivity, there was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice, a human being that had never been lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
Now, normal happens by the beauty that give us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could transmit one thing to Yemen and Sam and to you, it would be they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- they're a gift! Each one of us has a gift inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normality is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness, progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what should have been to be Alice in the country of the wonders.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
He was scared . He was scared . He was scared of these students with his big minds, his big books and their big and unknown words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students . I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world as well.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to environment and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please welcome.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do that to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to answer you, and then what?
Give them why science is relevant to us.
They're not just telling us that they study the tricks, but they study the tricks, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And when you're describing your science, you care about jargon.
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say``space and temporary ,"but why not say``space and time ,"which is much more accessible to us?
To make them accessible is not the same as making them dumb.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can completely communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies . They're ways to fire and enthusiasm with their content.
And when you present your job, forget the signs of``bullet . ''
They've been wondering why they call``bullets"? The bullets kill, and they kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it's too supported in the area of our brain and we're overwhelmed.
Instead, this film of example from General Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of the tropics is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple, legible phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's described.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of wonder that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, for all media, harmony with simple . Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the whole dictionary of the Oxford English dictionary is``"  . ''
Just because it sounds very well.
And``" "means`` dishonest policy . ''
Although there was a newspaper editor in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said,``A hierarchy is the one that seeks a public charge without matter or platform or principle, and that, when you win, you get it by the mere use of a  reverse monumental monumental . ''
I have no idea what it means``respect . ''
Something to see with words, I suppose.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until, for example , 17 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the name of Brad  Brazil , who faced the Parliament.
They took him on the London Tower and they were incarcerated, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first used use of the phrase,``That "  ,"like the metal.
Most people think it's literal.
It's not . It's a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was debate in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions were presented that might be frustrated.
Some of you want to call the``State of State Washington ,"and others,``His Make George Washington ,"and other`` the United States Liberty advocate . ''
Not very attracted.
Some of you just want to call it``King . ''
They thought it was a quality of quality.
And not even with that, they were mountains, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain term.
And it could have served.
Everyone gets tired of it, because this debate was spreading for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor Senator, and I always write,``Still with this topic . ''
What caused the delay, and the way the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be empowered.
They didn't want to call her King in case he was given to him or his own idea.
So, they wanted to give you the most modest and more insignificant title that came up with them.
And that title was``President . ''
President . They didn't invent the title, but it just meant``someone who presents a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury.
And it didn't have much more relevance than the term``foreman"or``supervisor . ''
There were the events of little  small colonial fires and government fractions, but it was really an insignificant title.
And so the Senate is offered.
They said,``It's ridiculous, we can't call President . ''
\" This guy has to sign treaties and gather with foreign dignity . ''
\" And who would be serious with a  as ridiculous and insignificant as President of America? ''
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't fall.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to find out, the Senate has never really agreed the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is temporary, it's possible that we continue to wait for 23 more years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to leave you, is that President's title doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, the world's largest economy and a fleet of non-lethal aerial vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have hurt the title of  .
So in the end, the Senate won the Senate.
They got their degree of responsibilities.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a singularity.
But, you know how many nations you have now president?
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now the President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I'd like to leave you with.
politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually, it actually makes it easier much more the words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground in an illegal Ghana mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk, but most of all, that cacophony of male and stones in front tools.
As the others, I have a  a  a   a   a                  , and I've just got to the head with this orange plastic, and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that one meter from a meter that falls hundreds
He slipped my hand, and all of a sudden I remember a minority that I met days before, which lost the control and fell countless meters in that pump.
While I'm talking to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole, holding their lives without paying or reward, and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're a slave of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the University of Peace.
Among all the amazing people that I met there met an integral from the  the  the , an NGO that is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there existed in the world, but not to such degree.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very bad, honestly was embarrassed to ignore this approach of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was made a  the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the  the  the keys, and offer my help.
And so I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some, even, I considered them my second home.
But this time, ventilation the dirty deals.
A conservative calculation says there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout the whole deal of traditional slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
And yet, today, you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be born by $18.
Remarkably, slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without paying, under threat of violence, and they can't escape.
Now slavery operates on trade: goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disposable.
slavery exists in almost everybody, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met brick furnaces.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the hell of Daniel.
immersed in a 54 C temperature, men, women, children, in fact, whole families wrapped up in a                        in their heads, to 18 at a time, and they take them from the   the   the   the
Powered by the monkey and the tiredness work quietly, doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day.
There was no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe disaster would make it pee out pretty intriguing.
And so penetrate was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to revive it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the audience I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said,``Lisa, don't do it . Don't do it here . ''
And I was very clearly explained to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them into a worse situation that they were already.
I had to trust the Starrs, and work inside the system for their release and trust that they would.
As soon as me, wait to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children running stones for miles for mountains of mountains to the trucks who were waiting down.
Those big plants were more heavy than the kids who were charged, and the kids put them into their heads with homemade mail made of sticks, ropes and axes.
It's hard to show something so overwhelming.
How can we influence something so insidious, but so ubiquitous?
Some don't even know that they're slaves -- and they're working 16 or 17 hours a day without paying because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages turned out their freedom, the slavery were essentially burned home.
By hearing the slavery word we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, I was advised that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In Kathmandu, I was shocked by women who had been previously high sexual slaves.
They drove me through some anonymous stairs that gave this dirty basement, with fluorescent light.
It wasn't exactly a brothel.
It was rather a restaurant.
restaurants, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small, private rooms, where the slaves of their girls and children, some of just seven are forced to train the customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and dirty, identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their customers.
From foot in the proposition, I remember feeling a fear acute fear, and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be trapped in that hell.
I only had a output: the stairs where I walked in.
There were no backdoor.
There were no windows big enough to climb.
These people don't have a skeptic, and because we play such a difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sexual slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
Texas are another activity that we often relate to with the slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of the silk.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue and red tiles of their children.
They mix sharks in these big barrels and put the silk into the liquid to the elbow, but the ink is toxic.
My interview told me his stories.
\" We have no freedom ,"they said.
\" We still hope, however, can come out of this house someday and go somewhere else where our work really pay us . ''
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake Volta, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a ship, two older brothers, some younger children, make sense, right?
mistake . They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their traditional families, disappeared and forced to work out in these boats in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up, he was shaking, and he feared that his little canoe outside.
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of trees spread in Lake Valley often attract networks and children, relatives and fear, they get to the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are drowning.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee, and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, it essentially tries to younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were getting up the last networks, but they had been working from the one.
At night, it's windy.
And it's going to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued in a fisherman village.
I met it in a shelter in which I put the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the   the
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
He's driving by a road in Ghana with partners of  the  the  the , an archaeological partner with his bike suddenly accelerated and overcome our car and touch the window.
It asked us to follow it by a path of land to the rainforest.
At the end of the path, he inspired us to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go quickly.
Then he pointed out this very visible path and said,``This is the way, this is the path . We go . ''
As we started to go down, we took the ingredients that blocked the path and after walking about an hour, we found that the path was affected by the recent rains, so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as we get rid of these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the shrine ended abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and everybody was filled with enslaved workers.
A lot of women had children tied on their backs, and, as they were looking for gold, they walk in hot waters.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These mines are enslaved in one other part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were engaged in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet, and these people are carrying heavy bags of stone, and then they're going to be transported to another area in which they would shake the stone so they can extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be full of strong and violent men, but, if we look closer, we see to work to other less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of lesions, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this music ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and engineering in a few years.
This is Min . When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When you die your uncle, Mark inherited the debt of the uncle, which forces it to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, I'd worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in mine, so serious that doctors said that it should be amputated.
In addition to that, Bangladesh has tuberculosis, and not before that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Still, he dreams to be released and educated with help of local activists like the  the  the keys, and it's this kind of determination, face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give testimony of them and we will do everything that we can to help change their lives.
I just think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines . They're people, real people like you and like me, that deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these beautiful, battered people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in which you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force gets a fire and that fire threw light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math applied and there's a peculiar problem for who we do: we are like management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, try to explain what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
They delegate the virtues of the ballet and the dancing dancers that we'll see later.
But the ballet is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably certain initial attitude that can have a genetic component.
Sadly, neural disorders like Parkinson's disease, gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, like my friend Jane Street, who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet dancer.
In the last few years, it has been a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are six billion people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness, shake, stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and ultimately the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and accurate metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement, there's no biological markers, so it doesn't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a 20 minutes neurological exam.
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do . It's never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult trip to the clinic, and what if patients could do the exam themselves?
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So, what I want to provide you as no conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all virtuous as my friend Jane Street.
This is a video of the vibration of the vocal string.
It shows someone healthy as they go to speak, and we can imagine as dancers from a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the genes necessary . The Phoenix, for example.
And, like the ballet, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal strings as they vibrate, and as the Parkinson's disease affects the limbs, it affects the vocal organs.
On the bottom, you can see an example of irregular shake from the vocal strings.
Let's see the same symptoms.
vocal shake, weakness and stiffness.
The speech becomes more quiet, and it's taken after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How are these tests comparing based on the voice with specialized clinical trials? Well, both of them are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive . Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both precise . Okay, but also the tests based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be programmers.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're a minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets a cost so low: it appears to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the routine check.
With high frequencies, we could get objective data.
We could make low-cost massive recruitment for clinical trials, and for the first time, it's really doable by a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first frames of disease before it's too late.
So, by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's vocal Initiative.
Along with academic and PMTCT, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Anyone, with or without Parkinson's, can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you . Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who isn't?
What will you get from these samples?
Max Littman: Yeah, yeah . What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease . TR: Sure.
MS: You see, some people cannot pass it . You may not end it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, because we're looking for limits of confusion factors for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have 86 percent accuracy at this point?
MS: Much more than that.
Actually, my student Thomas, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well, which adds the project . We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Nine and nine . Well, it's a improvement.
MS: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much . Max Pitt, public.
MS: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I made photography rockets in New York City.
We are fixed creatures, gray creatures.
We hide in the dark, in fourth without windows, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do to the very even more thin models, the perfect skin, even more perfect, we do the impossible, possible, criticized us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11th , 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where it was voluntary, there was Hans  Hans , he was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to Oregon.
It's a little town of fishermen located in the head of Iraq almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet, and over three miles in the ground.
As you can imagine, the town was devastated.
We took debris out of channels and the sharks.
We cleaned up schools . We removed the slime and we left the houses ready to be renewed and resilient.
We removed tons and tons of dead fish, stinky,  of the local factory.
We were scared and loved.
For weeks, so much volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and pictures of photos and cameras and B cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They're going to pick them up and bring them to different places of the people around the people around them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered.
As a wave of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to add absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a village assessment center.
It helped clean the common bathrooms, the huge ones, giant bars.
This place turned out to be also the place of the town where the test center is the photos.
There they took them, and I had the honor that they would trust me to clean out the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, and I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizons, but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some who were over a hundred years old, some of them were still on the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking as a rocket how to fix that trait and repair that trait and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contact with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try.
So we started to portray the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too hard, but where the water had decorated the face of the child, it had to be fixed with a lot of precision and delight.
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of herself, and that would be as tragic as having the wrong picture.
Over time, they came up with a little bit more photos, and they needed more  , so it went into Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later , 80 people of 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people to join.
In Japan, in July, we mobilized                 a village in the north of Dave.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographic libraries that were installed, where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time that they took to deliver them is a different story, it depends of the rest of the photos.
It could make an hour . It could make weeks.
It could make months.
This chemistry had to draw virtually by using as the areas that color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures in salt water, covered from bacteria, with algae, even with oil, all of this together with the time step continue to destroy them, that's why it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't touch the picture unless I was clean, dry and had been touched by his owner.
We were lucky with the cleanliness by hand.
We've got the guide of an admirable neighbor.
It's very easy to damage even more of the photos already.
As Bonnie once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought these pictures were lucky in relation to photos.
He had started cleaning them herself, but she stopped to realize that he gave them even more.
It also had duplicate.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be able to rebuild, we could solve the images in a single picture and delay the whole picture.
When I picked up his pictures, he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found photos in a bomb station between the rubble pretty far from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the Sirens sound.
Their little kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and knew that they had all survived.
The day he would give her pictures his younger child, she was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could go back to, something that could remember from the past that would not have been marked for that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined that there were helping us to clean up by  about 13,000 photographs, the vast majority, the vast majority of their owners.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring 90 families to a fully restricted and withdrawn picture.
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They're guards of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take, but the first thing we would get back to it.
This was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is going back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the writers.
Some of them connected to something bigger, to give up something, using their talent for something that aren't a perfect skin model.
So, to finish, I'd like to read this email . I sent it Lincoln the day I came from Japan after six months.
While I was writing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in images.
One particular, a picture of women from different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, moved around me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my daughter recently born, hangs our wall.
In the whole world, all the time our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doc Edison inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that reaches an apple in an exhibition of just one million second.
But now , 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present you a new type of photography: the demographic -- a new technique so fast that you can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the corners, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and actually challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer, and it's going to go into a trillion of a second, or it's, in many ways, you'll create a picture of photons of just a millimeter wide.
And that package of photons, that bullet, travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shoot on this bottle, how do those pictures spread inside this bottle?
What is the aspect of light in slow motion?
Now, all of this -- remember that all of this is effectively less than a banker is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't take this research . It happens a lot of things in this movie; it's going to break this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet, comes into the bottle with a packet of photons that start to go through and, inside, starts to wake up.
Part of the light, he goes to the table, and we started to see these ripples.
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, waves travel through the table, and because of the reflection on the top, you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several frames, that the reflections are concentrated.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet, and we make it back the same distance, and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film of a bullet lens in motion.
And what about to try with death nature?
You can see the waves that you would take from the table and the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way the nature painted a picture, thought, from a mammogram at a time, but, of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato, you'll realize that as the light gets off the tomato, it goes up bright . It doesn't dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature, and the light bounces inside, and it comes out of several trillion seconds.
In the future, when this demographic is in its mobile phones, you can go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographer, you know, if you take a picture to low exhibition, it enters very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I'll just go into some light.
We sent that bullet, that picture of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very carefully , we took these gigabytes of data and we're going to train them completely to create those feminism that I showed you.
We can take all that data in raw and process it in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future was supposed to see after the corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door . bounce it into the room, a part is going to be reflected on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bounces.
It's not science fiction . We've already built it.
On the left, it's our demographic.
Behind the wall, there's a scale, and we would rearrange light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Commons.
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera, but interestingly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our demographic, has unique capabilities.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So, we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point I'm going to do to what distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a picture in gross, which, you see on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, will put them together and try to analyze the multiple light bounces, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's going around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build electrodes of seeing the inside of the body by holding alone, and the same for amateurs.
But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is pretty difficult, so this is actually a asking scientists to start thinking about mammography as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of imagination in the next generation.
So, like Doc Edison, he himself a scientist, turned science in art, an art of  photographs.
I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we collect are not just for scientific views.
It will create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves . Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few trillion seconds.
But there's something funny about here.
If you look at the waves underneath the cap, these are coming away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording about the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
By applying the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
It's time . Thank you.
Hello . This is my mobile phone.
A mobile can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, go up to Cornell and make famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a  from 1984 and live in Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protected for a change.
This is the fall of 1989 . Imagine if all these people gathered in search for a change, they had a cellphone in the pocket.
Who in the present have a mobile here?
Get them out.
Raise your mobile phones, pick them up!
Take them . An Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot . Almost everyone has a mobile.
But today I'll talk about me, from my cell phone, and how life changed.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35,000 lines of information.
gross data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U . Commission presented a direction.
The Department of Data.
This directive says that every single Internet provider, every Internet provider, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who, who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and up to two years, in its phone company or its Internet provider.
And across Europe, people were planted and said,``We don't want this . ''
They said they didn't want this database.
We want the self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phones and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said,``We don't want this . ''
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to Berlin streets and said,``Freedom, not fear . ''
And some of you even said that this would be the Three.
The State was the secret police of Germany.
And I also wondered if this works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the cell?
So I asked my phone, Deep Tyler, who at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please would send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask, and I didn't get a concrete answer . It was all blah, blah.
But then I said,``I want to have this information because you're protecting my life.
So I decided to start a court lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But Derartu TEDWomen said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, we signed up a agreement.
I will remove the demand, and they send me the information that I asked.
Meanwhile, the German Christian Court failed creativity for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly sea of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD, there was this.
Thirty and five thousand lines of information.
At first I saw them and said, well, it's a huge archive . OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little skeptical: what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I'm, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data metaphor means.
So, next to Jessica Online and Oprah Data City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom back and forth, go back and forth.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I'm going from France on train to colony, and what I call in the journey.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife, and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them.
And then one call the other, and the other one, and we ended up with this great network of communications.
You can see how their people communicate to each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the group leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who gives you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the 1989 fall, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the State would have known who involved in this protest, and if the State had known who leaders were, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, in fact, the fall of the iron of iron.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But self-determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for uncertainty.
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and that's not fashionable.
When you go home, tell your performance that just because companies and state agencies can store certain information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what data stored from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you to remember that you have to fight for uncertainty in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I'm called the          , and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, advising the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain palsy, that's why I shake all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting . I'm like a Shakespeare mixture.
and Muhammad Al.
The T is not genetics.
It's not content, can't contract.
No one's labeled my mother's uterus and I didn't hire it because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It just goes through accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of the present.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from walk.
Christmas Christmas, they're in the shopping center, they drive in circles, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think,``God, can I be at least a little bit disabled? ''
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P C is just one of them.
If there was an opportunity of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should.
I'm from Park Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initiatives.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
Many people with brain palsy don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the``can't . ''
The mantra of my father was,``You can do it; dancing song . ''
If my three older sisters cleaned, I clean.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents gave the school system, and they made sure that I was too, and if we didn't get out all the maximum note, we all received my mother's shoes.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five, putting my bags on his feet and just walking.
Another tactics that I used was to pick a dollar in front of me to perceive it.
The series that I carried inside was very strong and ...
Yeah . The first day in the childhood garden walks like a boxing champion that has received many taps.
Growing, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs, and they're still all of the family . I think no one realized we were not Italian.
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think of``hate to Muslims"as a campaign.
The people who grew up had no problem with my faith.
In fact, it seemed to be a lot of concern that would die of hunger during the branch.
I told you that I had enough fat to live three, no eating, so I'm going to help the dawn to dusk is very easy.
Big cap in Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway . My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, or I can walk with vacation.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends were using heels, I also.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jerusalem, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer, we would become Madonna.
In summer vacation in summer, my father was trying to heal me, so I drink the deer milk, put hot cups on my back, put me into the Dead Sea, and remember that the water burned my eyes and I thought,``It works . ''
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga, it was a stand-up comedian that I couldn't stand on foot.
And now I can hold on the head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the General Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the USA, University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the cubes.
It was like the pet department of theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the note maximum in my classes, and also in your classes.
Every time I made a scene of the crystal zoo my teachers cried.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the E.U . decided to do a piece called  a very slow dancer in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain palsy.
I was a girl with brain palsy.
So I started screaming the four winds,``In order to have a paper!
I have brain palsy!
At the end, the free end!
Thanks to God, in the end I'm free . ''
I didn't get the paper . They gave Miss Brown.
I went to   to go up to the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if anybody had killed my cat, to ask why, and she told me that because they believed that they could not do the risk stunts.
And I said,``Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts, I can't do the character . ''
It was a role for the one that was literally born and given to an actress without cerebral palsy.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a single story of hearing actors without disabilities for disabled papers.
By graduation, I went home, and my first car spin was like extra in a TV.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be "``" better friend"to a holy friend.
Instead, I stayed there as a vase, didn't see me more than the one, and it was evident to me that the repair directors didn't hire fat, not white actors, with disability.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at Whole Goldberg, Rose Barry, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
That's why I became a humanitarian.
In my first tour, I took famous cartoon from New York to New Jersey, and I would never forget the face of the first cartoon that I took when I was going to the account that I was going to high speed by the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had cerebral palsy.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and without veil.
Some people say that I'm the first  in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I do know that they never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean  , and I launched the New York City Festival Festival, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Republicans in media media, and at the same time remind the director directors that sweat and Arabic are not synonymous.
To integrate the Arabs was much easier than fighting the stigma of disability stigma.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was kind of invited to the cable news program, and I've been invited by Keith Forget.
I went into a graduation dance, and I went to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the principal and I said,``Excuse me, can you give me another chair? ''
She looked at me and said,``Five, four, three, two . ''
And we were live!
So I got attached to the desk desk, so I won't get out of the screen during the segment, and when I finished the interview, I was pale.
In the end, I had my opportunity and I did it . I knew they wouldn't invite me.
But not only the Mr.      to invite me, but it was like a full-time participant and I pasted my chair.
A funny thing that I learned with Keith  with Keith Force was that people on the Internet are scarce.
Kids are said that children are cruel, but they never get rid of me or a child or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became object.
I see online clips like,``Why is it shaking? ''
\" Is it taken? ''
And my favorite:``Poor  terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really hear for her . ''
A coach suggested even that I would add my disability to my rsum: guitar, comedian, paralyzed.
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make Beijing, then Beijing can't make somebody in the wheelchair.
The disabled is the -- yes, clap, man . Come on.
The disabled is the largest minority in the world, and the most  in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown with media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children well.
My toaster has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk through the red carpet floating through the  the  the   the  the Susan Tech and the  the London Arts.
I came to act in a film with Adam   Adam  and working with my pain, the incredible Dave Matthew.
The world is going crazy.
I was dedicated in the great state of New Jersey in 2008 in 2008.
And I founded``The Kids of May ,"a charity of a charity to give kids Palestinian refugees a whole part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me in live, and I dedicated this talk to his memory.
in peace, Dad.
I'm called the       , and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little village in South America.
This town is close to Mogadishu.
The drought pushes the little village to poverty and to the edge of the innovation.
Without anything to him, it goes to the great city, in this case, Mozart, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city out of Mogadishu.
After maybe a rough year, nothing.
One day you read a gentleman that offers you to take it to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast.
It knows a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, to his family.
They present a young man.
He finally got home.
A new life starts.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mogadishu, under a blue sky, bursts a car car.
That little boy from that little village with dreams of the great care was suicide bombers, and that dynamic group of people were the Shabaab, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a little kid in a small village trying to get their dreams in the city, ended with him getting wet?
He was waiting.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for her future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he came.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call``wait period . ''
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the marathon, young urban young people who were developing riots in Johannesburg, they would destroy riots in London, looking for something beyond waiting.
For young people, the big dream of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, wealth, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are going to be less than 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the waiting period, the access door to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the history of the cities.
And in my hometown, Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work, don't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit the English Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in the back of that tragic hospital, thinking,``If I would never have gone? ''
What if I'd been forced to be in that same``waiting period"?
Would I have become terrorists?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in Mogadishu that month was actually to bring a few juvenile leaders into a corporate farm.
It brought together about 90 Somali juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was .
He went to University University, he graduated.
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me, because I was a graduate college, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mogadishu, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Twenty years of civil war has completely destroyed the viral system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize.
Agnes saw an opportunity and take it.
He started a motorcycle company.
He started pumping motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 engines, with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the``waiting period . ''
It favors young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamed, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mozart has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came up, if you wanted flowers for your wedding, you were used to plastic from the foreigner.
If you asked somebody,``When was the last time you saw fresh flowers? ''
For those who grew during the civil war, the answer would be,``Never . ''
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a  a floral landscape and design company.
He created a farm out on the outskirts of Mogadishu, and he started growing           trilobites and light, which he said, they could survive the   the   the   the   the   the Mozart's climate.
And he started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in Mogadishu in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink pink.
By the way, he doesn't farm pink because it uses a lot of water.
So, the first step is inspired young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be a  of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They brought corporate solutions for local problems.
So inspired young people and create a corporate spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need experience and guidance to guide them in development and put in their business.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, to bring the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park, that's how it's created, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
They went to hire children from the street to help rent and keep the motors for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the``waiting period . ''
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, they turn young people in entrepreneurs, they get together and they feed their inherent innovation, and they'll have more stories on flowers and Peace parks that self-esteem and``waiting periods . ''
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad at the  mountains, a area that was the north of the New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The Central forest.
The sun made the leaves shine like a military, and not to be the way we followed, we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings to put that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a record with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed, there was a trash, about four square feet of apples of      aluminum paper balls, and old cocaine.
And I was angry, I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The camps that were too lazy to get what they had brought, who thought it was going to clean their trash?
That question followed with me, and it's a little bit easier.
Who clean our trash?
No matter as an organization or where you put the``ours ,"who clean our trash in Istanbul?
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or London?
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean our trash, which is about 11,000 tons of waste, and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does the uniform feel like to use that load?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through their tracks and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and learned a lot, but it was still an intruder.
I needed to go further.
So I started working as a trash reward.
Now I didn't just travel on trucks . I drive them.
And he operated mechanical scans and bars the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong, you get very strong.
It costs a lot to be used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept adding the weight to take on their body tons of trash every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the resilience of waste is one of the most dangerous occupation of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and you're going to go around you.
They just want to happen, so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is filled with dangers that often fall from the truck and provide terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the oculus and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It's never going to stop coming.
It's also like a form of breath or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic, because I strongly believe that waste collection is the most important labor of work in the city streets, for three reasons.
They're the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of waste, efficiently and effective, every day, this starts to fall from your containers and your inherent dangers are threaten in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to  and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old people, we don't have a space for what the engines in the economy start to fail when consumption is in danger.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, it's just its relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed.
And with that, I mean just the speed that we used to move in contemporary time.
We don't really care, we don't repair, we clean, or we carry with us, our coffee cup, our bags, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that will get to it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and include it in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost                 .
They're on the street every day, in a rhythmic form.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to wait.
And their work allows us to make ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, of our own waste, our democracies, and that flow has always been keeping a shape or another.
One day after September 11th , 2001, I heard the manager of a waste truck truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs running, and there was a man doing his paper record journey as all the Wednesday did.
And I tried to thank her for doing his job that day in particular, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me, and I just nodded, and he said,``Let's go right.
Let's be right . ''
Soon after that, I started investigating the collection of waste, and I went back to that man.
It's called Paul, we worked together, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that Pauling was right.
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts for figuring out the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have in account all costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The municipal waste, what we think about when we talk about trash, represents three percent of the number of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean the trash of you, a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking in our community life by becoming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall shopping center in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was,``I want to get out . ''
After looking at some of these buildings, there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to highlight.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to get a lot of energy because the crystal with crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees in the whole year.
And third, you have nothing to do with Africa or with Ethiopia.
It's a shame by taking a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really engaging with the ancient market that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small marketers.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by inspiring the site, which is located in a very much growing area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the entries in the building.
And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates a free air space in the building that , by its own shape, from sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor due to the shape of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete shell of concrete  to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a filter way.
We then inspired these beautiful buttons of Ethiopian dresses.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the facade.
We're building that with these little ready-made pieces that are the windows that allow the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is completely filled with these little crystals of colors that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought,``That's not a shopping center . It was not what we ask . ''
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the shopping center because at the end of the way there was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy supply for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting physicists on the roof.
And then under those panels, we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these dogs on the roof, which in a set of water collect water for the healing health.
It's expected for early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a $2,000 and services plan in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest one I've designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on the medina, a 1,000 year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was to expand existing streets, creating 12 individual blocks in size and characteristics that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic dots in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in medieval climate?
And it's North, because it creates a thermal difference between the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we're supposed to make sure that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the low plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density in higher levels and a smaller density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The ceiling, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like reversing the community, the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and they can go up and make activities like running a couple of two miles in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives change communities and local economies to the same pace as buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple, but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new child entered our class . It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had great amounts of hair very brilliant, and a little bit of pencils, cute . It was very strong for the states of the states, very good for irrigation.
I ended that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister plan.
I stayed a time after the school out of school, and it was a little late, and I hid on the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was cleared, it went out, went into the classroom, took from my teacher's table, the rating book.
And then I did.
I altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit, just some of them.
All like that, and I was going to go back to the book, but, to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a frenzy, the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of Dan and myself, just for being there, since I could ...
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea emerged.
I don't understand why I felt good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was that everything was completely obvious.
I never discovered.
But most of all, I was missing the reason I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for origami.
I get into the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so compelling.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates . The blue birds are very likely.
We know that the jealousy are the number one cause of spouse killings in America.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzed loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So, you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study the jealousy in all your possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no Helvetica, there would be``Odyssey . ''
There would be no fancy king, or``The  the thousand and a night . ''
There would be no Shakespeare.
They would disappear the reading lists of high school reading, because we would be losing``The Noise and the War ,"there would be no gavage,`` ."We would lose``                 "
Without jealousy, there's no Proust . I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost it has all.
This year , 100 years of his masterpiece,``Look at the lost time ,"the most successful study of sexual jealousy and also the ordinary competition, mine, everything we could have . And thinking about Proust, we have the sentimental details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a Mediterranean  in the washing tea.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forgot how implemented it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia Wolfram said, they were as hard as a glass of cat.
I don't know what the cat cap is, but we assume it's super.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the jealousy, the jealousy and the Proust.
Is it going to be very obvious like the jealousy, who reduced to the person, to their desire, to their taxes, are a very solid narrative base?
No . I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being both storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details including, to clear the knife, right?
The jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and that's something that Proust understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could empower another, maybe right now . ''
And it starts to tell itself that story, and since then, Proust says that every fresh love that Sharon detects its lover, attached it to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Sharon and Proust, they were notoriously jealous.
You know, Proust's boyfriend would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so jealous to recognize that it's hard work . Right?
The jealousy are exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion . You have to feed it.
And what are the jealousy?
The jealousy is nurtured from information.
The strains use the details.
The jealousy likes the great amounts of bright hair and the cute and small of pencils.
The jealousy is nurtured from photos.
That's why I Instagram is so successful . I promised the language of the language with the jealousy.
When Shadi is in his jealousy of jealousy, he's suddenly listening behind the doors and bribe to the servants of his lover, then he advocates those behaviors.
He says,``Look, I know you think this is disgusting, but it's not different to interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a memorial . ''
He says,``These are scientific research with real intellectual value . ''
Proust is trying to show that the jealousy are         and they make us seem absurd, but, in their mind, they're search for knowledge, search for truth, a painful truth . In fact, to what Project will be, the more painful the truth, the better.
Pain, humiliation, loss: These were the tracks to Proust wisdom.
He says,``One woman who we need, which makes us suffer, causes in us a much deeper and more vital sense of feelings than a wise man that can be interested in us . ''
Is it telling us that we're going to look for cruel women?
No . I think it's trying to say that the jealousy reveals ourselves.
And is there any other excitement that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals our agency, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotions that teaches us to look at so peculiar?
I Freud to write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife deceive him.
And Freud says there was something weird about that man, who didn't look at what his wife was doing.
So she was innocent; everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he looked for things that did his wife, without realizing, involuntary behaviors.
Sound too much, or is it accidentally broken with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the course of the unconscious of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
novels describe very well how the jealousy makes us look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the jealousy leads us to make violent or illegal acts.
The jealousy drives us to behave in completely unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about my case at 8, I recognize it . But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan in 52 years old was captured to have created a false account on Facebook since he was sent, horrible to himself, for a year.
For a year . It's a year.
She was trying to get into the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, and I have to confess that when or this, I react with admiration.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big, albeit, creativity, creativity . Right?
It's like novelty.
It's like a novel of Patrick Feynman.
Hitler is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the``strangers in a train ,"and``The  Mr. Ridley ,"books that are trying to be how the jealousy, trust our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what it is that it might be, can be perfected in an instant.
Take Tom Milgram, his most famous character.
Tom Juliet is going to want or want what you've got to get from your self and to stand out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor . It responds to your name, it takes your rings, you empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take Tom Milgram's route.
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I want.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy times.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is envy? Right?
The novels show us the output? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to  the                                               , and we're asking
When people think about Hollywood, think of the curse in the  in Professor Moriarty, that criminal genius.
But I've always prefer [to ] Lester, the head faces of Stephen Street's rat, which needs Hollywood desperately, needs Hollywood's genius, but it's annoyed.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lester needs its help, but the residents, and bubble with bitterness in each of the mysteries.
But how they work together, something starts to change, and finally in``The adventure of                ,"once Hollywood comes in, it goes back to all of their solution, Lester goes back to Hollywood and says,``We're not jealous, Mr. Hughes.
We're proud of you . ''
And he tells him that there's no person at Scott Street who wouldn't want to shake her hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Homo trapped in history . I think this is very emotional . That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a Hollywood minute is the opposite side of Lester.
The next minute is the same side.
Suddenly, Antarctica allows you to admire that idea of being him.
Could it even be so simple?
What if the jealousy is really a geometry issue, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to resist the other.
We can align with it.
But I like the continent plans.
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction to consume.
Just the fiction of the  the jealousy.
The fiction alone has the Dominican, invite them to the table.
And look at what's going on, the sweet
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 , 1969, Buzz Aldrin came out of the Apollo  the Apollo 11 and disappeared on the Sea of .
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the surface gray gray was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization in the American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including Apollo 1 crew.
But before the Apollo show , 24 men traveled to the moon.
You walk on top of its surface, from which Al-Qaeda after the Armstrong death last year, is now the oldest one.
So why were they?
They didn't bring a lot back : 37 pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 , a new sense of the tiny and the fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical response is they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets, that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962 gives us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: Some ask, why the moon?
Why make it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the highest mountain?
35 years ago, why fly on the Atlantic?
Why play Rice against Texas?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Pogue: For the contemporary, the Apollo was not just a West victory about this in the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was to wonder the transcendence of the power of technology.
It was because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological success.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and airplane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the police was eradicated and removed smallpox.
Technology seemed to be about what Alvin  in 1970 called`` acceleration force . ''
For most of the history of humanity, we cannot go faster than a horse, or a sailing boat, but in 1969, Apollo 10's crew flew to 40,000 miles.
Since 1970, no human has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10 crew, and the optimistic joy about the power of technology has evaporated when we see that problems that we can imagine how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have intractable results.
I remember looking at Apollo 17.
I was five, and my mother told me not to look at the  the  the  the Saturn  the Saturn .
I knew vividly that this would be the last big mission, but it was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from``something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology ,"has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like technologists had been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhones, apps and networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated selling.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enrich our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a computer explanation in Silicon Valley, who trust that they've created less ambitious companies than the years in which Intel was funded, Microsoft, Apple and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, in concrete, incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused the creation of transformative ideas for the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what goes wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their degree without worrying about the risk, they prefer small investments, tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The CIA . They've always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term . They have never invested in developing technologies, to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But Mars will require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels . Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the biofuels.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price . They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policy and international deals with the development of an alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of coal prices.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for time that famines are result of failure in the food repair.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famine are political crisis that affect catastrophic food distribution.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food repair, but there will be famine as there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes give a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need, but these four elements have to be present: political leaders and population must want to solve the problem; institutions must support the solution; it must really be about a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for technology capacity to solve big problems, and it's about those criteria.
But it's a role model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There's no cognitive competition like in the Cold War, there's no policy like John Kennedy who has the hard and the dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the general ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they become cliche of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a memory: there's been a great decrease of trust, it's a very pervasive belief.
Second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should recover trust.
I think the memory, the target, and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a memory, a goal and a task, that I think a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all: why do people think the trust has decreased?
And if I think about it about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I encourage myself to think that it may have been diminished in some activities or institutions that might have increased others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can go to the opinion surveys, and the opinion surveys are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the survey polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who went down 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same mistrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago remain quite reliable: judges, nurses.
The rest are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost exactly halfway.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls record are, of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
I trust politicians? Trust in teachers?
Now, if anybody would ask you,``Do you trust them?
You trust the fishermen?
Do you trust teachers? ''
You'd probably start to ask,``To do what? ''
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question,``Well, I trust some, but in others not . ''
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel about a certain kind of official, functional or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school microscope.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust more abstract?
I think the polls are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to operate the good inherent judgment at the fact of trusting in something or someone.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
And frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I'll pursue.
I would start to have more confidence in what's deserved, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a believer to not trust what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are deposited their savings with the very appropriately called Mr. , which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too confident.
To have more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
It trust, or denied with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a trial about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if you find that one person is competent in the perfect materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I wouldn't trust them to bring a letter to the mail, because they're forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competition.
And I'm very happy to say I think I don't have many friends who are competent and responsible, but extremely dishonest.
If it is, I still haven't noticed.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust.
Trust is the answer.
trustworthiness is what we need to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to one piece and said,``Well, you'll see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative paper that will attend the side itself . ''
And we found the same problem in our whole public life, and institutional, that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee trustworthiness and evidence testing, is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they make the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the midwives, tell them that`` the boxes ,"as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
Everything, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more reliable, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy, and we're going to convey people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy . It's the judgment, the simple actions, the attitudes, what doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
To call the task to rebuild trust, it puts things into the area.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in definition, is distinctive because they give us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough bases so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't deceive, usually, to all people, all the time.
But you've also got to give some fossil evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's done every day, everywhere, the ordinary people, the officials, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks say I can get you back without giving explanation.
I get it and I get the money back, or you change them by the color that I want.
That's great . I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to argue.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers, we've been strive to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be broken.
This separation has been reducing, increasingly and more, to such a point today is less than one, the glass of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be like.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong disease against the screen will transform its physical body to pixels.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, you break the barriers.
But the two hands stay still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Microsoft's applied science, along with my mentor chaotic         the computer, and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
So, combining a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab directly with your hands.
As windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as to grab a book from a shelf.
You can take the book and take lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that's below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we enter the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make the digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and drop things out on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual test on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or translated when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel?
What would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborators        , we created this only physical pixel.
This spherical magnet is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that so much computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
simplify, what we did was we announced gravity and control movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical and detectors.
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach a physically and at the distance, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be replicated as a physical reality as we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel . It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us, without that we need to be disconnected from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gymnasium for two years in , China, in the '70s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to bring to a school for athletes with all expenses pay.
But my mother tiger said,``No . ''
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a critical path to happiness: a safe and a remote job.
No matter whether I want to work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer has to start to train from very young to learn the ants, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
Until I wrote to the school director, and at the present of a radio program.
But no adult would give it the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much greater to train.
My dream will never be done.
I feared, for the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another voice.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
It turns out to the books.
[" "  Country "] [aka] [`` lessons from``The History"] [`` lessons of``History"and I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
\" Good Earth"is the Chinese Christmas life.
And it's not a convenient propaganda . I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but odd.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation:``honor your father and mother . ''
\" honoring ,"I said,``It's so different, and much better than obey . ''
And so it became my tool to get out of this conference guilt and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place to my comparative reading habit.
A lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map seemed to me outside because this is what the students in China learned.
I've never had to be at the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contract, it provides academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can deal with people [``  Franklin"by Walter Isaac] [`` John Adams"] [`` John Adams"] -- that they were involved in a same thing, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the temptation are economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, it's all psychological: lust, fear and the social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
[" The path of Chuck Tzu"]
For example, it's through translation that I realized that``happiness"in Chinese literally means``fast joy . ''
And``girlfriend"in Chinese, literally means``new mother . ''
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know not to be feeling alone or powerless.
Having a distributed dream is really nothing that many others have suffered.
I've come to believe that it's not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a dead dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books that I'm here today, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So, the books always take them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychologist of psychotherapy.
I was a medical student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman called Alex.
Alex went into the first session using cowboy, and a  hip, he threw on the sofa of my office, took the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so relieved.
My classmates had a sign as a first client.
And I took a letter that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the funny stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to just move the head as we broke the solution.
\" The Greeks are the new 20s ,"Alex said, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working afterwards, you house after, you have kids later, to death happens later.
For vegetables like Alex, I had time.
But shortly after, my supervisor pushed me to press Alex to talk about his loving life.
I resist.
I said,``Oh, of course, it's coming out with guys under its category, and it's hit with a head, but it's not as if it's going to marry him . ''
And then my supervisor said,``No, but maybe it's married with the next one.
Also, the best time to work at Alex marriage is before it's married . ''
This is what psychologists call``Aha! ''
It was when I realized that the 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what they used, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex a pause in their development.
This made the top 20 of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized, that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for race, families and future future everywhere.
There are 50 million vehicles in America today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one gets to adulthood without passing before the 20.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the vegetables here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with vegetables, you love a vegetable, you take the dream out of the dream, I want to see . It's okay . Amazing, the green real matter.
This is not just my view . These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35.
This means that eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and``Aha ,"that they shape his life will have happened to when they have 30 and so many.
People from over 40, they don't train in panic.
This audience is going to be right, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on how much money they will win.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years old.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20 and you breed for adulthood, which means that if there's something that wants to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20 than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its house at the age of 28, and things become complicated at 35.
The 20 are the time to educate on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment when your daily and common life has an impact on the person that will become.
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the juveniles are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline of adulthood.
Researchers call the 20 an extended adolescence.
journalists, you name ridiculous names to the vegetables like``  ,"and`` "  . ''
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial that actually defines adulthood.
Leonardo Bernstein said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give them a pat in the head and say,``Do you have another 10 years to start your life? ''
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition, and it doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, intelligent vegetables, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like that,``I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count . I'm just killing time . ''
Or they say,``Everybody says that while starting a race before 30, everything will be right . ''
But then it starts to sound something like this,``My 20 are to finish and I still have nothing to show.
I had better rsum the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it starts smiling something like this:``My quotes for the 20 were like the game of chairs.
They're all running and fun, but then at some point around 30, the music took off and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one sitting in stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I was 30 . ''
Where are the vegetables here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it doesn't get wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1930s, there's a huge pressure to the Greeks and so many to start a career, pick a city, choose a couple, and have two or three children in a much shorter time.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressed to do everything once at 30.
The crisis of the middle-aged age is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give your son a brother.
A lot of trains and frames look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and talk about their 20,``What was I doing? What was I thinking about? ''
I want to change what the juveniles are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but he could still not decide, so I spent the last few years working as a summer.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more term than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, his previous life had been even harder.
He cried often in our sessions, but then she was lifted himself by saying,``You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends . ''
Well, one day Emma came up his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
He had just bought a new book for the conductor, and he had spent all tomorrow by crying with his many contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that goes after the words,``In case of emergency, please call...''
I was at the point of history when I saw and said,``Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident? ''
Who's going to take care of me if I get cancer? ''
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and not say,``I . ''
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really cares.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex to just sit while the decade of Emma was going in front.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all vegetables, man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma to forget about that identity crisis and get identity capital.
By the capital capital, I mean doing something that adds value to its person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that interface, of that company that you want to test.
I'm not discovering the previous exploration, I'm discovering the exploration that should not be counted, that, by the way, is not exploration.
It's prostitution.
I told Emma to explore jobs, and I would make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are surviving.
The best friends are great to bring them to the airport, but the vegetables that are together with friends with similar minds are limited as they know, what they know, how they think, how they think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will go out almost always comes out of the nearest circle.
New of the new things come from what they call friends friend friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the vegetables have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and weak bonds are the way of color to this group.
Half the jobs created never are published, then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is how you get a job not published.
It's not cheating . It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a vegetable, Emma soon pick his family, when he has a couple and his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose her family had come.
You may think that 30 is better age to sit in that 20 or even 25 and agree with you.
But choice the person that you live now, or you're now going to get you now when everyone on Facebook starts walking into the altar is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as intentional in love as you are at work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to work or kill time with whoever you pick them to you.
So what happened to Emma?
Well, we got that principal, and she found the roommate of a cousin that worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That piece of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that I lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organization of events in museums.
This married one man who chose consciously.
He loves his new career, he loves his new family, and he sent me a letter that said,``Now emergency contact spaces are not big enough . ''
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with vegetables.
It's very easy to help them.
The vegetables are like planes that come out from the Los Angeles airport, who come out of the west.
Just before the takeoff, a slight little adjustments in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fiji.
In the same way, at 21 or 25, and even at 29, a good conversation, a good break, a good break, a good TED Talk can have enormous effects in the next years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the vegetables that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I have now the privilege of saying to vegetables like Emma every day: The Greeks are not the new 20, they're going to remember their adult, they get identity capital, they use their weak links, they choose your family.
They're not allowed to define what they didn't know or what they did.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in green consulting for a job that was even more demanding, the dictionary.
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied testing and testing.
I give you tasks.
When the job came back, I calculated the grades.
What called me the attention was that I.Q . . wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance had no IQ scores.
Some of my smartest kids weren't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in the seventh degree, surely, are difficult: proportions, decisions, the area of a race.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years, more than dozens, I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivating perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better.
It's the CIA, but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than ability to learn very quickly and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of challenging scenarios, and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the military Academy.
We tried to predict what they're going to stay in the military training and who will retreat.
We went to the National Center of Delhi, and we tried to predict how children they would get as far as possible in competition.
We studied novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking what teachers you're still teaching for the end of school and those, who will be the most effective to improve the results of their students' learning?
We partnered with private companies, wondering, which of these marketers are going to maintain their jobs?
And who's going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, a feature arose as a success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good emergence, the physical health, and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to cling into its future, day after day, not just the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it's a marathon, not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my determination questions and then wait about more than a year to see who they graduate.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of graduation, even when I packaged them in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that the children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just West Point or in the National Department of Delhi where determination matters . It's also in school, especially for children in risk of abandoning it.
And to me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how much science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,``How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach children a solid job ethic?
How do I keep them motivated for the long term? ''
The most honest answer is: I don't know . What I know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their commitments.
In fact, in our data, it's completely not related or it's even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth mindset.
This is a developed idea at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Dewey has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to lose when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mentality is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech will end, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to draw them, to start all again with the lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan like the daughter of a lane, one of my most scary memories is my mother showing beauty, shape and figure of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a foreign, it seems to be as unlikely as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can download this wall, so that what I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and fast method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic will understand 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 to allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read transit signals, restaurant menus, understand the basic idea of websites or the newspapers.
I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
People.
If the fire shape is an arms person on both sides, as if you're screaming in a fresh way,``" ! I'm burning ,"this symbol is actually original of the shape of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of gates from a symphony in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If anybody walks back, that's``follow . ''
As the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying,``It was this big . ''
The person inside the mouth, the person is caught.
It's a prisoner, like Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree . Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
They put a table under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's an idiot . Easy to remember, because a front tree is pretty idealistic.
Do you remember fire?
Two fire together, it becomes very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burning.
To us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperous.
Three, those are flashes.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon . .
A door . You put a table inside the door, it's the brain of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Is there somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, climbing, assessing.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing.
Three women together, they're careful.
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radiologists will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same as a eight-year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a fire of fire . It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the land of the national sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains, one another.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese employees displace their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, the exile has become going out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a output.
This is a slide to remember that I should stop talking and down the stage . Thank you.
What I'm thinking about being dad is the movies that I come to see.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we saw the Oz magician together.
The movie mastered its imagination for months.
His favorite character was Gene, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our kids in a kind of industrial complex show of childhood.
However, the Oz magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a fourth years later with, interestingly, another film whose protagonist, a metal boy and a hairy kid rescued a girl dressed as an enemy guard.
You know what I'm talking about? Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Oz magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the apples.
But I think if the Oz magician was done today, the magician would say,``Dorothy, you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy predicted.
You use magic shoes to defeat the  a computer of evil flu.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz magician is that the most heroic, wise, even tribes are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had gone down, and therefore, he died in the room and he was impressed as a mom standing with his patterns behind, and I didn't think he understood what was going on, but, incidentally, he would absorb everything.
I wonder what I perceive.
Would you be issues of value, perseverance and loyalty?
Would you have the feeling that Luke joined an army to defeat government?
Let's compare this with the Oz magician of 1939.
How do Dorothy win his movie?
It's going to make good mines with everybody and being a leader.
It's the kind of world I want my kids to grow Oz, right? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital force, force in movies for our children, and so little from the yellow bricks?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it . It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know, I know, the Princeton Princeton doesn't provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that is blended . I think at the time of the first kiss, I really expected that the credit to start up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why stop there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the princess of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the kids, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the patriarchy, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as                         Mars and Kansas, but they don't stop being movies.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continue to appear in classical after classical, each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who were creating a child.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend it to all of you . It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when it came out?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a princess.
It's very good . Don't let that stop them!
Well, almost none of these movies are going on the test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still no roots, and it's already spreading, but maybe we'll start a movement.
Alisa Meggendorfer is a comic drawing of comics, and in the middle 1980s, he recorded a conversation that he had with a friend on the evaluation of movies that they saw.
And it's very simple . There are only three questions that you have to do: in the movie, is there more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to get the requirement.
Are these women talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else about the kid who like so much? Okay? Thank you . Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens . I've seen it, and yet I really see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality.
Right?  Russia, Oscar success, an idea of consensus of what a Hollywood movie is.
Pretty much, it doesn't happen to Beethoven's test.
And I don't think I should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen her, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the hostage crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this hide, and it's the great time for one of the activities to take a look at the door and say,``You come to bed, honey? ''
This is Hollywood.
So let me go in numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have female protagonist?
Okay . It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a greater number that's going to be disappointed this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women say it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the videos of music or pornography are closely linked, but something was wrong, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual farmers.
Who are those guys? What are they learning?
What don't you learn?
Are you looking at the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't speak?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very alarming statistic, and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our disposal as a power, and we hope that it will help, but I have to ask,``I have to be able to protect you if, at the same time, active or passively, are we educating our children to keep their own male power? ''
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our kids, a new definition of man.
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You'll have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the cliff.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was her favorite character of Star Wars know what he responded?
.
surgery           .
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anybody, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell my son,``Go and struggle only and more stories where you see their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the Oz magician . ''
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I liked most was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was used to search for them.
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me pick them up.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and archeology.
And finally when I started studying the Egyptian, I realized I'll see with my own eyes not enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of a half miles of length to the Nile.
And my sea cookies had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that it had to do otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using infrared.
This is a place located in the East Delta Delta called Benki.
And the place, at the point, seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared, and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and activities of ancient Egyptians.
And I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city called the , called the , which is lost for thousands of years.
interviewed was the old Egypt capital for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the Pharaoh, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Ivan was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built them, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge plane plan.
This area is enormous, it's about 65 for four miles.
Before, the Nile fluid right next to the Internet, and as it changed over time, it was going through the whole city.
So how do you find a single city in an extra landscape?
Trying to find random is the equivalent to look for a needle in a haystack, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves.
So, we use NASA NASA data to make a map map, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile fluid.
But you can see more detail, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of the Internet.
So we collaborate with Egyptian scientists doing show jobs; you can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the sample shots in ice, but instead of climate change layers, we seek human occupation layers.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of ceramic objects.
This means that in this possible location of Iraq, five feet below, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that data from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is Ivan.
We also found fishing jobs, coral, quartz and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Empire jewelry, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find Iraq here, but we're going to go back to the place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in Iraq 4,000 years ago.
sharing knowledge is the biggest of all the voices.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So apparently, TED was not founded in 1984.
They make ideas happen really in 1984 to C in a lost city not for a long time and found from high.
It certainly puts the pursuit of marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine from foot outside, in front of the door.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that you're done.
Now you can visualize a group of obese noises in bicycles.
They're competing in a military bike race and they go in direction to their front door.
I need you to see this really.
They're getting strong, they're sweating, they're going out a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in absurd places . They pass the door of the door.
To the lobby, to the hall, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, the light light on the Galapagos monster.
I'm waving them with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks.
They can feel their blue hair by making them tickle in the nose.
You can smell the oats and steps that you're about to get into the mouth.
They pass on one side and train their living room.
Already in the room, and making more of its imagination, imagine Britney Spears.
It's with a little clothes, dancing on its center of center, singing``"  baby, Baby One More Time . ''
Now join the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with yellow bricks, and from the oven, you come to you Dorothy, the   the    the                  the                 the     the
Okay . Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the United States Chamber.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a science journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise supermarket.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different hygiene habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compare to see who could memorize the order of a storyteller.
And I thought,``This is incredible . ''
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best trained memories.
I said,``Ed, when did you realize you were a wise? ''
Ed answers,``I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everyone who participate from this competition say they have normal memory.
\" We've trained to make these miraculous memory acts using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used Cicero to memorize their speeches, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was,``Go . How did I haven't heard this before? ''
We were standing out of the room of competition, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit exciting, he said,``Josh, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Spears? ''
And I said,``What? No, why?
\" Because I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize order in a live bank deck, in national television.
That would test the world that anybody can do it . ''
And I said,``Well, I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
So, you have to start for something right? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also researching, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called the E.U.
He's a   a , very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a memory problem; it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Point . He was based on the paper of Justine Hoffman in the movie``Rain Man . ''
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorize telephone books; it was hundreds.
And when I came back, I read a number of treaties about written memory something more than 2,000 years ago in Latin and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned so many really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained, disciplined and cultured memory was not a thing as rare as you can look today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide dramatically their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally, and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultured memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that singular; there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College in London invited a group of memory champions, the lab.
Do you want to know: Is it that you have brains in some ways, structural or publicly different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
And yet, a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brain campaigns and the control subjects that they compare them.
When they put them into a magnetic resonance machine, they scanned their brains as they memorize numbers, faces and forms of snowflakes, and they found that in memory champions are lit in the brain, different to others.
They actually used, or they seem to use, a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is driven as an armed career where every year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors need to get a day.
This is my friend Ben Prize, three times champion.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36      that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 41              ,   .
Yes.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competition, absolutely all the techniques used at the end are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call`` "  "  "  "   . ''
It illustrates with a paradox known as the "     "              "        "     "    ,``  , I tell two people who remember the same word . I say to you
That's his appetite.
And then I'm asking you,``Remember there's a beep . ''
And when I go back later, and I ask you,``Remember that word that I told you a while ago? ''
\" Remember what was it? ''
The person who was told that his name is Baker's is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who told her work is``black . ''
Same word, different memory capacity; that's rare.
What happens here?
Well, the name of Baker, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
All the other memories that you remember in your head.
But the word,``black ,"we know baker.
They use white hats.
They have flour in the hands.
They smell well when they go back to work.
We probably know some baker.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we started putting affordable penguins to give them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data for 2,500 years in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the``memory Palace . ''
The story says this: there was a poet called``                      a banker . ''
They had hired it as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring a DJ, it hired a poet.
He stood up, he got his memory poem, and she moved, and so soon she went, the ballroom room collapsed.
killing them all.
But it didn't just kill them all, but it shattered the bodies to leave them wrong.
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't bury the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Sydney, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes, and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where every invite had been sitting.
I took the families in the hand by getting them where their loved ones were loved between rubble.
What Sydney warned at that point is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions per word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exciting space.
If I asked you to get the first 10 words of the story that I've just told you about in Sydney, it's very likely that it's very difficult to do that.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the front horse in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember, the more crazy, crazy, funny, weird, expensive, is the image, the more impossible it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first treaties of memory, in Latin.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it memory, the same way that you'd done Cicero, if you invited it to TED 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to give up some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy, unforgettable image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely inadequate competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and you can see the  the  the  the  the  on Mister Ed.
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Coke.
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then you go into the kitchen, and the fourth theme that you would talk about would be that strange journey that you did for a whole year, and you have some friends to help you remember it.
That's how the Roman speakers memorize their speeches, not words, that will confuse them, but typical by typical.
The term``typical ,"comes from the Greek Greeks, which means``place . ''
It's a dress of when people thought about the orphanage and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase``First ,"would be like the first place in its memory palace.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got full of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this substance of competitive democracies.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that the memory competition is a pathetically boring event.
Seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on exams . I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets killed in front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Perhaps a poem, or the names of an ancient school ship bought in a puzzle market.
And I discovered that this was incredibly entertaining.
I would never have expected it to be.
It was entertainment, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, cartoon, provocative, insult, absurd and , in the eye of mind.
I'm pretty hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard standard team for memory competition.
It's a pair of ears and some security glasses covered with tape only two holes, because distraction is the worst enemy of a memory company.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before . I had the idea that I could enter, in a kind of participatory medical experiment.
I thought this could be good for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition, something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to memorize speech, and phone numbers and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because it's based on pretty basic principles on how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building the memory blocks or memorize radiation bars, and to benefit with a little bit of practice on how your mind works.
We're often talking about people with a great memory as if it's an innate gift, but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
Let's remember when we're deeply focused.
The memory of memory -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even real shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing, a whole kind of attention that most of us don't want to exercise around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things make memory.
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today, it's what Peter, the ambulance that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our short existence to lose in the Blackberries or iPhones, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks on our side . We will be so annoying that we don't even bother in processing?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of the story of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just add a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from``No"Jersey, I was six, and I lived there at home of my parents in a town called
On the corner, from my bedroom, there was the bathroom that I share with my sister.
And, between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the room to be.
And all of them were going on the while watching the TV, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody saw me, and every time I got stuck and I went back to a towel, everybody sees me.
And I was like that.
It was awkward, insecure and hated.
I hated that journey, hated that balance, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings, those emotions that I feel, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, not to division of zones, but of those visceral, emotional connections that we feel in the places that we occupy.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
So , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I'm going to show you:``power ,"`` stability ,"and``democracy . ''
And I know that you think about it, you know, in a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a unexpected that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection; we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid soldiers, in front of the ocean.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who build . planners and governments, always have fear to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we find buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Library of Pittsburgh who ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome; it has this round, columns, red brick, that you let the
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, he ended up another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to get together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the pendulum.
On one side is innovation, architects that constantly drive new technologies, new types, new solutions for current life forms.
We drive, we're moving and we're going to move so much, that we're completely moving out of people.
All of black, this depressed us . You think we feel very well, but we're dead inside because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to connecting with those appreciated symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like    , so we start to experience again; we make the pendulum back on the back, over and over again . So we've done it in the last 300 years, and clear is, in the last 30 years.
Well , 30 years ago we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called " brutality . ''
It's got to do with concrete.
That can guess.
Small windows, in the
Really very hard.
So, we approached the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and act them.
We add up and add cake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give a hug.
We take Creative arms and we turn them into skyscrapers, which can be medieval crystals made of glass.
The shapes get caught, they won in audacity and colorful.
The dwarf became columns.
The kids grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was 80, that was great.
We all spend the rat in commercial centers, we moved into the neighborhoods, and there in suburbia, we can create our own architectural fantasies.
Those fantasies could be the Mediterranean, the French, or the Italian.
Maybe with a bread of bread sticks.
This is what's happening to  with the radar.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated, and we started making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s, in the early '80s, we started experimenting with the so-called destructive.
We download historical symbols; now we have new design techniques of design dedicated design, and we find new compositions -- a few ways that crashed against other forms.
This is academic and embarrassing, and it's super impossible; you're totally excluded.
Normally, the pillar pendulum again in opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building is opened.
It's the Guggenheim of Bilbao, from Frank Gehry.
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Dylan said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critic, academics and public in general, were completely agree about a building.
The New York Times took this building of miraculous.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden everybody wanted one of those buildings: Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Springs.
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these shapes, wild and radical, how can they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of beginning of the new millennium country with other star architects.
It happened to Z and to Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects in the new millennium threshold, actually started to happen with all the architecture . The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think, for example, how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
transportation goes up: you can take a ship, an airplane, can be tourists.
Technology accelerates . You can see in the newspapers, on the TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now -- that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before knowing that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The brutality was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they stopped.
That's never going to happen again . I think, because we're in the biggest revolution of architecture in architecture from the invention of concrete, steel or elevator, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the media to media, it starts to get faster and faster, until you're in both extremes in simultaneous, and it's effectively defined the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make almost instant symbols, with emotional charge, of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company recently ended up.
We were hired to replace this building that came up.
This is the center of a village called                             in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was done, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly to the finished product, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community . That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes the collective memory, and when we charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those libraries from Elvis.
If that building is built today, we first went to the Internet, looking for new libraries.
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's ammunition.
ammunition that can lead to the mayor of Lincoln, to the people in Liberia, and tell you that there's no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use complicated words and complicated drawings, and you're no longer a public audience that doesn't accept anything that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't let them invest by architecture.
That means that the optical pendulum of one style to another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that the buildings of tomorrow will be very different to buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city in Seattle can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical mimic of red brick in the basis of what it has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we're finally ready to be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are fed to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or for yoga, or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East River in New York, and to raise half a million dollars from the community united around that cause, it's no longer a customer.
It means that no building is too much too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of remote,  as much as the animals that are going to look at.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more ecological, smarter buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, control it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they shape it to the smallest spaces, the local libraries, the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Steve.
He just turned on a year, and she started walking.
And it does it in that great way, typical of the children in a year, taking me, as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally precious.
And one of the things that I like to do at the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and white, and it gives itself those big and wet kisses.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all your friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think: When do you stop doing this?
How is it that suddenly we're not going to deal with our appearance?
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month , 10,000 people look at Google,``Am I ugly? ''
This is Fayza , 13 years old, and he lives in Denver.
And as any teenager, it just wants to be wanted and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little scary, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him the whole while he's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Between what her mom says, and what his friends, or school partners say, doesn't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her itself, publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a comment,``Am I a nice or a ugly? ''
Well, so far, Fayza has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so unpleasant, that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy, normal, current teenager, which gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving them to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, chatting, giving``I like ,"by eating, sharing, publishing, publishing, this is never finished.
We've never been so connected before, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said to me,``It's like there's a party in your room every night . ''
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are imperfect.
This environment, of being connected, is going to be attached to our kids to self-assemble in the number of``I like it"and the kinds of comments that they receive.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what's manipulated.
What is the most respected thing in someone's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from girls' news.
Zero acid models continue to dominate our papers.
The tech technique is now a routine.
And you trend like,``                       sadness,       hydrogen, and the bikes, the , and it's going to happen . ''
For those of you who know it, it means propaganda.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are comparing.
But the guys are not immune to this.
Like the top stars of the sport, and the pink singers.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, surely, we want our kids to grow healthy and are very balanced individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects start suffering.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see the beautiful enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contributions to society and to the labor development field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments . They avoid participating in classrooms because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspect.
One in five are not attending classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you see enough good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough, you'll get a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about it about appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, America and China.
And it's regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So, so we're going to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on its body is building academic performance.
And it's also doubling health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more no healthy diet that can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them, and they're in higher risk of depression.
And we think that's why they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drugs, dramatic diet, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and without protection and  damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is leading to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of exercise.
17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way they see.
Think about what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity would be?
releasing this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, by talking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways . The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs, without realizing, worse the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas . The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial parties for any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental, but to address this problem requires each of us that we take the wheels in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
By challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to talk about the contribution of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of their breasts, or to innovate that determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by making responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you kiss a mirror?
In summary, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up value all of their person, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a pedestal.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they're never going to be able to be who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who's in mind?
To your wife?
To his sister?
To her daughter?
To your niece? Your friend?
It could just be the woman who's two seats away, and what would it mean for her if he was released from that artificial voice inside, that he was really excited about not having long legs, higher museums, a  more flat feet?
What would it mean for her if we overcome this, and we would say laughing to their potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is bringing us all together.
But let's get to our kids the truth.
Let's give you that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and because of what they do, and as they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in the corners of our schools.
We change each of us, the way we speak and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small after a year today, they become a safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November 5 , 1990, a gentleman called      in Manhattan and killed the Arab rabbi  , the leader of Defense Jewish League.
Now, they initially declared it, but being brought by other minor charges, in company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including tunnels and synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Luckily, those plans were frustrated by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, could not be avoided.
Later, I would be convicted for its participation in that settlement.
Al-Shabaab   my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer, with a lovely American mother, primary school teacher, between the two made all possible for giving me a happy child.
Only when I was seven, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims, come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to desire the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human groups, there's always a little fraction of people who are so closely attached to their convictions that you think you have to use all the possible media for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he sat down with me and explained to me that in the last few weekends, he and some friends, he had been going to stone training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the   the   the  , and we didn't know our group, was tied by the FBI.
When I got to throw, my father helped me hold the rifle on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim the target at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I gave to the little orange light on the target, and to surprise all of them, especially the whole target is in flames.
My uncle was going to the others and in Arabic, he said,``Great audio . ''
From such a father.
All of us, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later, I understood what it seemed so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
These people later were going to be convicted for putting a hundred pounds of explosives in the underground parking parking in the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hybrid at another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them`` ,"which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times . That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about somebody, it was time to commit and go to another city.
As it was always, the new face of the class, it was a victim victim.
I held secret my identity to avoid being the white, but being the new of the class, silence and reference, it was enough ammunition.
So most of the time, it was going home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons, I didn't develop social skills, to say it gently, and to grow under , it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators, like their race or their religion.
So how could I open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in my thinking was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a college program in which I participated at the juvenile National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence, and as I had been victims of machine almost all my life, it was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from diverse procedures.
One day, to the end of the convention, discovered that one of the kids who we had friends with was Jewish.
I took several days to go out this detail, and I realized that there was no kindness between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that I had all life to believe that it was   that it was .
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a amusement park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience turned out to develop my character.
The whole life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, all women were bad influences.
By accident, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most polite and the less critical I had seen in life.
Having been taken in a child, it developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy to treat friendly people, exactly the way I'd wish to be treated.
For that sense, I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be homosexual, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the``Daily Show . ''
Every night, Jon Stewart made me incredibly honest to my intolerance, and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my patented figure at a time when I was desperately following.
Sometimes, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, extremists, wasn't in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to consider in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who's suffered enough with endless dogmas and said,``I'm tired of hate . ''
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not Z Ibrahim.
He changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why do I decide to go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, someday, who is trying to bring violence, can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that although I was connected to this violent and intrinsic ideology, I didn't get fantastic.
In contrast, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice.
I do it for terrorism victims and their loved ones, and for the terrible pain and losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For terrorism victims, I'll talk, against those meaningless acts, as a rejection to my father's actions.
With this point, I'm exposed here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you very much . Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a movie that's projected in their minds.
It's an incredible  a film.
It's in 3D, and it's got mail of what you hear and see right now . But that's just the beginning.
Your film has irony, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you're projected to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking flow.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything in direct.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing that we know more directly.
At least, I know that I have a conscious consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal movies?
Why aren't we just robots that we're going to get to produce results without experiencing the internal movie?
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
Then there can be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I predict that vision.
psychology studied our behavior obviously, the neuroscience studied the brain objectively, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then , 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said,``Now it's time for science to love consciousness . ''
And since then, there was a real explosion, a flourishing of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic . It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness of consciousness in the recent years was the search for correlations, correlations among some brain areas and some states of consciousness.
We saw something from this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kurzweil presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science science.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain it by saying that this kind of neuroscience work answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness . The questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't deal with the real central mystery of this matter: Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective internal film?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, give me a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like the  the hurricanes, like the hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical emergence is all cases of emerging behaviors, how the bloggers operate, how hurricanes work, how they breed, they adapt and metabolizing living organisms . They're all questions about the objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon: how we walk, how we speak, how we play chess; they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why that all behaviors is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is, the standard paradigm of emergence, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of uncertainty that works . For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're standing on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, great . We're used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is kind of an anomaly, something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are going to look crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal movie movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do is to explain objective functions, brain behaviors, and so you study everything you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionist, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time I left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks: space, time and mass.
Put fundamental laws that government, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Rather, it's considered fundamental, and there's the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental goes away.
In the 19th century, he discovered that they cannot explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of elementary fundamental concepts, space, time, mass, Newton laws, so I zip the basic laws of electromagnetism, and postcards electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws govern.
I think that's the situation where we find awareness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, charge, then by the logic, you have to alert the list.
The most natural thing would be the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a science object.
It opens the way to handle it scientifically.
So what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts: space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can tell them in a paddle.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can tell them a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws they are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called``bread ,"for all,``,`` ,"per mind, every system is aware, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob Knight, the elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking.
It's not that a photon can be filled with anguish when you think``Oh, I always travel to the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the pink . ''
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling, subjective, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so crazy?
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems illogical, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to thinking with the physical process is to link awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
complex information processing, as in a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing, simple awareness.
One really exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscience, Gillian tone, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called a  the degree of information in a system.
And I suppose that you have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible high degree of information integration, a high degree of faith, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse, there is a middle degree of information integration, just like pretty significant, very important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the dog's degree says.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony's theory, there will be a level of awareness of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness: high degree of pop, high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that pandemic can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking explains,``Where does the fire of the equations go out? ''
From the popular vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of additive.
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, the pandemic vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and can have pretty serious social consequences.
Some can be illogical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be vegetarian.
If you're a paleontologist and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your visions, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consideration is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Samantha artificial intelligence system in the movie``Hey? ''
Is it conscious?
According to the view of popular information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off.
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of full collective, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, and now we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole TED group, different from the inner movies of each one of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that should be taken seriously.
So this particular view, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that in the second, that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If no, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve overnight at night.
But I think we'll finally get it to discover.
To understand consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victorian.
He had a very normal profile, a low school profile.
I went to school, came up with my friends, fought me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community approached my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said,``Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't got anything ."And they were right.
I went to school, I had good notes . After school, I had a low profile on my mother's hair, and I spent a lot of time looking at`` the Voice  ,"and``Dawn's Creek . ''
Yes, I know what a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school in Melbourne, just after about 20 minutes in the 11 class of legal studies, a guy raised his hand and said,``Hey, when you give your speech? ''
And I said,``What? ''
Well, I had been talking about the law of diffuse for a good 20 minutes.
And he said,``You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about individual things in school? ''
\" Usually, in the act room . ''
And that was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disabilities as an inspiration objects.
And we're not . And it's not a kid's fault, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our  our .
We're not real people . We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage by looking at what I do in this wheelchair, and probably you're waiting to inspire you . Right? Yeah.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to detect you.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to disability.
Yes, we've sold the lie that disability is a bad thing, to capital, M.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make any exceptions.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one:``Your excuse is invisible . ''
Or this one:``Before I quit, Intel! ''
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the child without hands drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term deliberately, because they apply a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we cost the disabled in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, to motivate them, so that we can see them and think,``Well, so bad than my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person . ''
But if you are that person?
I've lost the story of the number of times that they've been terrified to say that they believe that I'm brave or an inspiration source, and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was happy to get up in the morning and remember my own name . And this is to apply.
These images, those images cost people with disabilities in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
We overcome some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term``disabled people ,"deliberately because I'm whispering the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very close with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to apply them in the way that we do, when we share those images?
When people say,``You're an inspiration source ,"he says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us exceptional.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here beating inspiration, and you think,``Oh God, Steve, aren't you sometimes inspired by something? ''
And actually, I know I am.
I'll learn from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more fortunate than them.
I'm going to learn that it's a great idea to use a little bit of barbecue to pick up the things that fall to me, and I'll learn the ingenious trick of how to load the battery of the mobile phone in the chair of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnostics, but against a world that is exciting and it costs us.
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude ,"the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the middle of a stairs has never done that it becomes a branch.
Never . So smiling on a television screen won't do the subtitles for deaf people.
It's not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and making a positive attitude to turn all those books into the bank.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom by watching``Bush the Voice  ,"doesn't be considered not from anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of people with disabilities that we're happy to raise from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the overall achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a 11th degree from the 11th degree in a school school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
disability doesn't make us exceptions, but question what you think about it, you know it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do augmented reality and professional football, with empathy?
And what is the average speed of a monster without charge?
Unfortunately, today I'm going to answer one of those questions, so, please don't be disappointed.
When people think about augmented reality, think about``"  Report ,"and in Tom Cruise putting hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, that's what I'm wearing, the Google Glass glasses.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might don't know is that Google Glass is a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what's going to run through the game field at 160 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a 110 pounds of man is missing us, trying to detect them with all its being.
I've been there and assure you that it's not nice.
I bring some videos to show you what Google Glass is under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NFL practices, because the idea of the emerging technology of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface, but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Gwen: Come on.
It's horrible to be approved.
A moment . Let's get it a little bit.
Ready?
Go!
Chris : as you can see, it's a testament of what is being played in the football field, from the perspective perspective.
You realize that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, the University of Washington University.
field: mice      , mice 54!
Blue 8, Blue 8! Come on!
Chris : this is a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at the NFL.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and I've been wondering on YouTube and Twitter,``You can see from the angle of a  a field.
So, from a runner?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with Gordon and Google Glass, how do we get from full, how do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called                     High Rift.
The Rift School has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing! No!
Oh, my God! Oh!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain having its life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video from Adrian Peter crossing the line, falling away from a machine with the arm before running and doing an notation? What will be the experience of a fan.
When can I be   running through the song, launching the ball at the bottom of the network, or could I be able to make a shot in Johnny?
What will be your experience when you wake up from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a Olympic skier?
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even augmented.
It's just virtual reality, VC.
How do we achieve augmented reality, RISD?
We will reach the augmented reality when the coaches, the bonds and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think,``How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win games? ''
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win . They give them money.
So, here's a brief report on technology at NFL.
In 1965, the dishes of Baltimore put a way to his field yard to play faster.
The Super Bowl won that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL put radios in the helmet of the field juggling and then in the defense of defense.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2030, imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and they see their next play shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you take, you don't have to worry about forgetting a game.
Or to memorize strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose parties.
If you lose parties, you wake up as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just one manual of better strategies.
The augmented reality is also a way of collecting information and using it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
What would you do?
Well, a very simple option would have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are below.
They also get information from the sensors and the accelerometer sensors, something that's already working.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will be sending it.
Bad ones will have information overload.
This is going to tell the good teams of bad ones.
So your computer team will be as important as your recruiting, and the data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will be for sports . Who would have imagined it?
What would it be like in the field?
Imagine it's the field maker.
You get the bullet and back.
You look at an open receiver . All of a sudden, a flashlight on the left side of your bombsight, you're attached that a defense behind you is going to attack it . Normally, you don't see, but the RNA system warn you.
Give them to the protection area.
Another flashlight is old, there's an open receiver.
You wash the ball.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land . However, the receiver sees in its bombsight, an area of grass, and it can modify the career.
It's right, it's catching the ball, it's running and it's old.
The public turns and the fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'll make lots of people see, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus, like our usual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports league.
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show an abuse how their actions are from the perspective of the victim?
How much does this technology is worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how you live by being pursued?
How much is it going to be also for a   to a   a  a  a  a  a , a  a  a  a , a  a  a  a  a  a  a , and a  a  a  a  a generation of children to think more in space and
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is about.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, depend, as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retired about 23 years of service in the High Pacific High School.
Most of those 23 years, I was going to patrol the southern end of the County County, including the Gordon Gates Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, which is known mundane by its beautiful  San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiration style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Gordon Gates Bridge was open in 1937.
Joseph Strauss, engineer chief, who had been able to build the bridge, said that,``The bridge is virtually to test suicide.
The suicide of the bridge is not practical nor likely . ''
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been idealized as such, so that the fall from it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you what happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body hit the water about 100 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which drill vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
Those of us who don't, usually get scared in the helpless water and then drowning.
I don't think that those of you who contemplating this suicide method realize the death of death to the death.
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel steel.
This is where most people go before to take life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in their darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young year was talking to an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful that day to bring it back on the gang.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who contemplating suicide, but the officers also.
We've gone a long way since then.
Today, veteran officers and psychologists train the new officers.
This is Jason Carnegie.
I met the 22 of July last year by getting a call from a possible suicide subject sitting in the mountain near the center.
I responded, and when I came, I looked at Jason talking to an official from the Golden Gate Bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to two times before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason, we wondered if we knew the story of Pandora box.
I'm going to remember the Greek mythology, Zero created Pandora, and he sent her to the Earth with a box, and he said,``Never, you would never open that box . ''
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
She came out of pests, sorrows, and all kinds of evils against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us,``What if you open the box and there's no hope? ''
It stopped a few instances, leaned on the right, and it was.
This nice and intelligent guy in New Jersey has just taken away the life.
I talked to Jason's parents that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family's rabbi called me to see how it was.
Jason's parents had been asked.
The colonial damage of suicide affect many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved outside?
What would you say?
You would know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, blame, or tell the person you know how it feels, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is suicide, you're not afraid to face them and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is,``Other people in similar circumstances have thought to end their life; have these thoughts? ''
To confront the person in front can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to search: despair, believe that things are terrible and that they're never going to improve; it impacts, to believe that there's nothing you can do about it, recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady, and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19th this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read them.
\" Hello, Kevin . I imagine you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite numb, but I'm going to notice more moments to realize that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from Zimbabwe to San Francisco to see the  in the 1940s with his father on January 19th.
I never got there.
I called the police police and repeated it as a disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came home and reported me that Mike's car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge at 380 of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without suffering a real mental illness?
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with your fight.
The GDP, the Gordon Gates Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Richard . ''
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and raise the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th , 2005, I responded to a radio call by a possible suicide subject on the top of the bridge near the north tower.
I drove my motor on the sidewalk, and I looked at this man, Kevin Bertie, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she immediately crossed the railing, and he stopped on that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the next and half time, I heard like Kevin talked about its depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he happy it.
\" This is a new beginning, a new life . ''
But I asked him,``What did it make you go back and give the hope and life another opportunity? ''
And you know what he told me?
He said,``You hear me.
I'll let you talk and just listen to you . ''
Soon after that incident, I received a letter from Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read you.
\" Dear Mr. Brilliant, nothing will erase the events of March 11th, and you're one of the reasons Kevin goes on with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was clear for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly measured.
I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those inherited traits, but, thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We thank God for you.
Honestly in debt with you, Natalie Bertie . ''
And at the end, she writes,``PM . When I visited San Francisco's Hospital that night, you would figure out like the patient.
\" Wow, I had to solve it! ''
Currently, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression in hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got suicide.
That act, despite finishing its own pain, stole the opportunity to know it.
This is what suicide makes.
For most suicide people, or those who consider suicide, would not think to hurt somebody else.
They just want their own pain to end.
Usually, this is just about three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol.
In my career, I've responded, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three occasions.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said,``Kevin, sorry, but I have to go . ''
And it jumped.
Awful, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge are not suicide.
Also, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who left from the side of the gang realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't only connect Mars with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that each and every one of us should be striving to do.
The suicide can prevent.
There's help . There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but on your inside you know what you are, and a question you ask, how do you become that?
I should be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally gotten the dream that I had since.
My outside finally agreed with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to remember later, when I look at this picture, I put this picture, and you get it, you get it.
But last October, I discovered that, barely, I'm starting.
All of us are encouraged by our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of release, to get rid of the limitations tax by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those people around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called epiphany.
This is mine.
They recorded me as``child ,"when I was born because of the appearance of my genitals.
I remember that my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me,``Why do you always take that shirt in your head? ''
I said,``Mom, it's my hair . I'm a girl . ''
I knew then how to self-assemble.
The gender has always considered an extraordinary fact, but now we know that it's something more complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I thought it's being bad, but how the world is about those of us who want to release.
Every day I appreciate to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess, a child's god.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrate these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me: This is the kind of woman I'd like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still 15, I met this woman called Tim.
It's the director of a    a transgender beauty.
That night she asked me,``Why don't you participate in beauty competition? ''
He told me that if she involved she would get rid of the insect spending and the waste, and that night, he won in bathroom, won in the rubber, and he was third, and he was over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty regions.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from queen of beauty women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the shoes, especially when we travel to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends from that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me, and I told you that I was approved my request of the green card that I could go to the United States.
I resist.
I told my mother,``Mommy, I'm dividing.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of beauty . ''
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said,``You know if you moved to America, you can change the name and the gender identity? ''
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I'd put two``and"to my name.
She also accompanied me when I operate in Thailand at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand, they do the most prestigious, sophisticated, secure surgeries.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before the name and gender.
So, in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the Global name and the``F"of female gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a journey, but for me it was the license to live, to feel worthy.
Suddenly, my fears were staring.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in the bomb                                 "
A young woman in New York who probably lived his truth, but that, disappeared, put end to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 in November we make a global surveillance for the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the   the
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who fought and stood up to injustice.
These are Martin P Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, exposing, so that some day there are no more surveillance of 20 of November.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you . KT: Yeah, a quick question.
Gloria Rockett: Sure . You'll see, first, thank all my blessings.
My own network of support, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women, who I've heard, and sometimes, when I was called and told me that their parents couldn't accept it . I took the phone, I call my mom and said,``Mommy, can you call this woman? ''
Sometimes it worked, no other . It's just gender identity, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we're all assigned by a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put the table on the table that sometimes that power doesn't square, and that there should be a space that would allow people to automate, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement is starting to compare to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understood.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you . Very nice . GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who you know about their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malaysia started his campaign by education defending its rights in 2007, and when their efforts were administered in 2011, when they were held by the juvenile Prize of peace, it became very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when when you're born a child, your birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not welcome, not for your father, not for your mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her comfort to mother and no one happy the father.
And a mother is very overwhelmed by having a child.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, it's shocked, and with the hope of a child, when you shake your third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother suffer, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five, when you should go to school, you stay home and school admit your siblings.
Until the age of 12, somehow, it has a good life.
It can be fun.
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it's 13 years old, it's promised to go out of his house without a male accompanied.
It's confined at four walls in your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of your father and your brothers and your family, and if you transfer the code of that honor assumption, you could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption code of honor, not only affects the life of a girl, also affects the life of male members of family.
So this brother, sacrifice the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in name of the honor.
And there's one more norm of patriarchal societies that is called obedience.
A good girl has to be very quiet, very humble and very sum.
It's the criteria.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be quiet and accept your father's decisions and mother and choices, even if you don't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if the marry with an old man, he has to accept it, because he doesn't want to be helpful.
If the very young house has to accept it.
Otherwise, they'll call it a desert.
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a poet,``The house, the face, and then gives birth to more children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, it includes the same lesson of obedience to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle goes on and on.
I wanted brothers and sisters, when Malaysia was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newly born, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt strangely honored.
And a lot before I was born, I thought about his name, and he was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi from Macedon, and he called my daughter like this.
But when I went, they were all men, and I grab my pen, and I went through a line of my name, and I wrote,``Bad . ''
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years, he admitted it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a child's admission in a school?
Yeah, I should mention.
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for child life.
It means the recognition of your identity and your name.
An invitation to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where you can explore its potential for your future life.
I've got five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks before, when I finished the Canadian , and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the footsteps of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen my sisters from my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the safety of my daughter.
I walked it to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
I encourage it to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to incorporate them in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for Malaysia.
I've cleaned all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I use education for exploitation.
I taught my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of the obedience.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the call.
You know, dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we struggled to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called a   a .
That means a complete denial of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced, the  girls and the murdered singers.
They were suffering millions, but a few people talked, and it was scary to have those people who kill and assume when you talk about your rights.
It's really scary.
At the age of 10, Malaysia got up and was lifted up by education.
He wrote a journal for the BBC blog, offered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and he talked to every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spreads like a climax around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the ninth of October 2012, they were shooting in the head.
It was a drug day for my family and me.
The world becomes a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was holding between life and death, he whispered my wife,``Should I blame my wife,``Should I blame my daughter, to your daughter? ''
And he said,``Please don't blame me.
It defines the cause right.
I put your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and joined you.
They were both in the right path and God will protect it . ''
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't wonder again.
When Malaysia was in the hospital, and he had severe pain pains and severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that stretches on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
I used to say,``I'm okay with my smile, and with the excitement in my face.
I'm going to put it right . Please don't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us, and you get us.
I wanted brothers and sisters, we've learned from how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
He cried when he didn't have his task.
He fights his brothers, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me,``What's special in my tutor that has been so bold to Malaysia so brave, expression and economics? ''
I say, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I don't cut their wings and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you.
I was operating from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Montessori group, where I've had a divide to my heart, the Google X visualization divide, but all the work I'll talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you join a brain operation.
Are you still the same as intelligent or not?
It will not be like that, can you become intelligent?
After the neurosurgery, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the   the   the center of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to make them, to continue with life.
More than once I've saved it.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't exist a clear map that says it in Delhi.
I started to try with different mix, and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the dose would dramatically change my authority, my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly awesome case: for a few months, I tried  doses and typical chemicals for a man of 20s, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts would change.
It was always furious, I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and -- of course, many times in the past, I've known several types like this, or maybe some of the adverse versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
In fact, I was trying, a very insecure thing, fixing a problem that I had in front, and just not that.
So I couldn't handle it.
I change my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to go through, since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do, when you adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference: how do you get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to? testing new ideas and recreating situations.
These kinds of thoughts is not new.
philosophers like Humberto, Descartes and Hobbes see things similar.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today you have to question this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works . It's simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative thinking and invention.
So, after several years, I managed to find the point right, and I have already lots of great mental components, really vivid, very sophisticated, well structured.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images quickly, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use its imagination just to steer the world that has in front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of their head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is just increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments made by two prominent groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional magnetic resonance, to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan done by George   by   by              the Harvard .
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the brain scan of that same individual as you imagine, seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by reading the content of the central column on the left . It looks like the difference is almost zero.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost zero.
Now let me share another experiment . This is from Jack Gallery's lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves in recognized visual fields.
Let's give it this way.
In this experiment, people were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were scanning their brains to create a great brain of brain reactions in the brain sequence.
Then a film was shown with new images, new people, new animals, and as a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using only the brain information of the scan, decided to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer rates, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us a little bit of them.
We're right close to doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture, and when you imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with the biggest brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't deal with that.
Many are providing new projection techniques for images, even me . With the recent outcome of the MRI, we should first ask ourselves the next thing, this technology will be the end of the path?
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, not increase by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than bigger magnets, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements, like making a choreographer.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in renewable solutions and brilliant solutions in coding and decoding, in the       the FM radio receiver in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a uniform magnetic field, we use  magnetic magnetic patterns attached to the frequency of the FM radio.
So, when you combine magnetic patterns with patterns of the frequency processing processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single scan.
Also, we can then divide in layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of brain and memory to create increase in the thousands we need.
By using MRI, we should be able to measure not only the fluid of organized blood, but the hormones and  neurotransmitters that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity . This is the dream.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above the language and communicate directly through thinking?
What would we be able to do?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filters?
You thought the Internet is big.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and disease.
We have few choices more than opening this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have arms.
His closet may be telling some person for the first time the lover or telling someone who's pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you've gone through in life.
All closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary tremendously, the experience of having lived and out of that closet is universal.
It's scary, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked at the South Side    , a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the Latin military: I wouldn't take my armpits, quote the letters of Ann Diego Francisco as a litany.
And I'm going to be aware that because of my short screen, and because I've been shaving my head recently, I would ask a little kid,``Hey, are you a kid or girl? ''
And it would appear an awkward silence on the table.
I would bring my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a rage leave.
The father would inevitably hold the newspaper, and the mother would throw a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I'd go inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
\" Are you a kid or a girl? ''
A family silence, but this time was ready, and I was about to enter the female affairs on the table . I had the Betty Friedman quotes.
The quote from Gloria Steinem.
Even a snippet of the``Vagina Monologues"to show.
So I'll breathe back and down the gaze and my backs a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what's not a challenge for a feminist damage, just a girl with a question,``Are you kid or girl? ''
So I'm going to breathe back again, I put out of knives close to her, and I said,``Hey, I know this is something that is confusing.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw a little kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than kind of girl from a comfortable pajamas . ''
And that little girl looked at me, paying attention, and said,``My favorite pajamas is purple and it has a fish.
Can you give me a party, please? ''
And that was it . Just``Oh, you're a girl.
What about the party I asked? ''
It was the easiest conversation of everybody ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the swamp and I, both of them, we were honest with one another.
Just like many of us, I've lived in some closet in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be an rainbow.
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different to yours or yours or yours.
Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons why to go out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours, but here's the thing: the hard thing is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you that to explain to somebody who's been declared in a broken bank is harder to say that it's been fooled?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than telling your five-year-old son that you're going to divorce?
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We've got to stop rating what's hard to be difficult to what hard to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in the closet, and they may make it secure, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what their walls are made, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that I had a horse tail, a high dress and a high heel shoes.
It wasn't the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child coming into coffee.
He was frozen in fear, turned on a corner of my dark closet by building my gay grandmother, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I ever did.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't release that grenade, you're going to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade launches was on my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I did my honor lady, in my black dress and a holiday, and I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents were, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women was yelling,``I love Nathan Lane! ''
And the gay asylum battle had started.
\" Huh, did you ever be in the beaver? ''
\" Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco . ''
\" Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fabulous . ''
\" No, you know my height?
It's very good, and it's never talked about having girlfriend . ''
\" Ahh, what is your favorite TV show?
Our favorite program? Will and Grace.
And you know who you love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite.
And then a woman, puzzling but in waiting to desperately show his support, to make me know that he was on my side, finally said,``Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirts . ''
And I had an opportunity at that point, as you have all the grenade launchers.
Sure, it might have been easy to indicate where they felt.
It's not very difficult to find it and realize the fact that they were thriving.
And what else can you ask somebody, but do it make a deal?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic you get.
That's how difficult conversations continue without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I've come out with.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the  of the Pentagon.
Now please look at this through the gay perspective, but they understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor . Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be genuine, the other people must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct . Just tell you . You're sorry.
If you know that they're gay, give him.
If you say to your parents that maybe might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important -- leave the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It's never apologize to it.
And some of you can go out safe, apologize by what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of them will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you find it in a closet, by using a grenade, you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but you're not.
Thank you, Boulder . Enjoy the candle.
Intelligence, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Einstein  that``The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . ''
When Erik  , when he wrote this, he did this as a critic to the pioneers of computing as Alan Turing.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race, that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes, and you can look at Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a Earthlings, we know that the reason we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept about the Earth's intelligence, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that will explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that will decrease the surface of a planet, they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that he took over several years ago, he analyzed a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, that they pointed, I think, to a single mechanism underlying intelligence.
In cosmology, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be extremely advanced for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that maximize diversity of future possible.
Finally, in robotic motion planning, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and putting them together, asked, for a number of years, is there an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is . What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to one E.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It's acting to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the options open, with a force T, with the diversity of future events accessible, yes, to an impending future time.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be trapped.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open choices.
And so, having in mind this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How risky is it?
Does it predict the level of human intelligence?
Does artificial intelligence predict?
So I'm going to show you now a video I think about, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: recent research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or``entropy ,"for their life, should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that critical cosmological connection between entropy and initial intelligence a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the long-term entropy production, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called                  the long-term entropy production in any system where it's inside.
Remarkably, entropy could go through multiple animal intelligence testing, play human games, and even making money by eating action, all that would have been invited to do that.
Here are some examples of entropy in action.
Just like a human standing human without falling, here we see entropy  automatically balance a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the pole.
This balance ability will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This use of tool use will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling off opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that entropy can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
entropy is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game against itself, illustrating its potential for play.
So here we see entropy to deal with new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keeps successful network.
This same network operating capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see entropy organizing the routes of a boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend the world's reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomy, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here, here we see entropy spontaneously to discover and execute a field of shopping, collective in a simulated series of action negotiation, successfully increasing the assets under its exponentially management.
This risk management ability will have broad applications and insurance applications.
Alex Wilson: What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive human behaviors such as tools use, to walk upright and social cooperation, everyone's derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony here.
Let's go back at the beginning of the robot term, the work``U.K. ,"there was always the concept that if we developed intelligent machines, there would be a cyber rebellion.
The machines will rise against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to reverse.
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then mix them and try to get around the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come up directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I'm often asked,``How is it that looking for targets to get rid of this kind of framework? ''
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is the next: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're in an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call home.
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
NASA's mission has discovered thousands of planets that orbit around other stars, which is that the Earth is only one among the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the luminous intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data collected by Kepler show the size of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother star.
Now, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and rocks like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their suns.
At its time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure of potentially livable worlds, our own planet is falling under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest record.
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us from millennia is now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to global scale have been rapidly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist scientist, no astronomer.
It studies the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that it looks for extraterrestrial opportunities in the demographic sector.
Now, as a very interested in life search in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets to Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invite a comparison between the planet recently discovered and the planets we know better: the of our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock and despite being a little farther from the sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, it's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our arms like``Curiosity ,"trace their surface to search for clues on the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit, like the  of the  the  the , take samples from Mars atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability.
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all these Martian images remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the wild ideas and pioneers, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that are still going to be colonized, really exuberant places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places of the Earth, the air is fresh and  oxygen spread by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for Mars colonization and other drag planets with a big and sad shadow: the implications and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save us from this information of the only planet that we know is really livable, Earth.
As much as I like the interplanetary exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity, it's like figuring out that the Titanic captain will tell us that the party actually will be more late in wild boats . Thank you.
But the targets for interplanetary exploration and the Earth preservation doesn't contract.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin: the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The environments are present in our world, like aliens.
Just close to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile areas and inhospitable areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment: the Fermi paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist of Enrico Fermi asked, to account that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become a technological advanced enough to consider to continue to live between stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect that development.
It's arrogant to think that only interplanetary colonization will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to empower Mars's hostile environments for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the skill on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see by the window they were at the dining table, where they had left them.
So I quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right closed.
I thought about calling a surgeon, at least I had my cell phone, but in midnight, a barrier could take a long time to get, and made cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night, because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I witnessed my passport and my suitcase.
It would happen to be expensive, but surely not more expensive than a  a  a  a middle of a night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it was good for me.
I'm a profession neuroscientist and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
It releases cortisol, which increases heart rate, modulate levels of adrenaline and cloudy.
And when I got to the math show in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, that avoid bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, they minimize the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't criticize.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kahn, Nobel Prize winner, and a little embarrassed I told him that he broke the window, and that he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the pressure.
Everybody knows what the poster is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the press, as Danny explain, you look ahead and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things that we can do in the form of a press.
Some of them are evident, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I'll figure out a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis, based on how our spatial memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where it's the good, where the fish are, which combines fruit trees, where the friends are living and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that will be added in London's taxis.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really made the experiment, they cut the full sense of the squirrels and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys of the car, and reading glasses and passports.
So at home, you go down a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a decorative plate.
For his passport, a particular cave.
For your reading glasses, a particular table.
If you go down a place, and you're    a little bit of your things, you'll always be there when you look for them.
What about travel?
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card, driving, passport, selling it by mail to themselves so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or stolen, this can facilitate the substitution.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
cortisol is toxic and cool.
So part of the practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is offered as a blueprint for all of medical decisions, and in fact for financial decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from which you benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says,``I've gotten the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a bit high . ''
Everybody knows that the high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, stroke brain.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best thing, then the doctor says,``I'd like to take a drug that will help reduce the cholesterol, a state . ''
And maybe you've heard about states, and you know that it's one of the most recycled drugs in the world today, and it's even likely that you know people who take them.
That's how you think,``Yeah, straight the state! ''
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you have to ask for most doctors to don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the CNN, the number you need to treat.
And, what is this, the CNN?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or give a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of bizarre statistical is?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not get me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not guilt of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanisms very well.
But the smartphone estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely prescribed state, which you think is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers, Jeremy Milgram and Pamela      independently confined by Bloomberg.
I'm exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another adverse event.
Now you may think,``Well, one chance in 300 to go down my cholesterol.
Why not, doctor? Give me the recipe anyway . ''
But then you have to ask for one more statistic, and it is,``Talk about side effects ."Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: dense muscle and articulate pain, hurt pain, but now you think,``Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the medicine . ''
But a moment.
Remember, under stress don't think of clarity.
So, think of how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get punched by the drug that will help you.
I don't say they should either take the state.
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires it, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the crash value, but actually this number required to treat is pretty typical.
For the surgery that you do in men older than 50, the number of prostate prostate, the number required to treat is 49.
That's what , 49 surgeries by one person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case is produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the privacy or the primary dysfunction, the urban incident, the straight legal, the fecal income.
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just will last a year or two.
So the idea of pressure is to think before time the questions that you can plant to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think of now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases cortisol under stress, and one of the things that happens at the time is that a lot of systems are turned out.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
For face with a predator, it's not necessary for the digestive system, or the release or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react fast . They could be the lunch of lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out of the window during those moments of stress is rational logical thinking, like Danny  , and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all flawed.
We're all going to fail from time.
The idea is to think of the future how they might be those failures, to put the systems into the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent that bad things happen in the first place.
the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor was installed by a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered, and lots of emails that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Philippe,``E"is my favorite music symbol.
It means to play softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a``P"in the score, you need to play more gently.
E .'"Even more gentle.
Four .' ''
This is my drawing of a tree' tree ,' there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of dollars can be, never going to be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence: a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American sign system, the NSA, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the decade of 1800, and with the time step, it mixes with local signs, and the language that we know today as 3D.
So, it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born deaf . And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
Sound are a very important part of my life, actually, in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sounds, it's like I live in a foreign country, following its rules,  ,  ,  ,  behaviors, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do you understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound.
I'm going to learn and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond.
So I've learned, for example ...
\" Don't shake the door! ''
\" Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the potato potato bag! ''
\" Don't exist, and when you're eating, I'm sure not to throw the covers on the dish . ''
This is all called``sound tag . ''
Maybe I think about the sound tag of the sound that the average person does.
I'm super  the sounds.
And I'm always waiting with nerves, the sound, that it's for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
TEDGlobal, for deciding.
FBI, for continuing.
TB, to announce.
You can see that the plant has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle and blobs.
In deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for``pravastatin"sign at the NSA.
A typical plant has five lines.
However, to do this with my thumb, it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces from different galleries, and as I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that called me attention.
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my art territory.
Is it going to distance more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well, not just through the ears.
I can feel a tactile way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and I decided to leave it.
I started to create a new job body.
And when I presented it to the art community, it was shocked with how many support and attention I received.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control: social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was oblivious, it was something from a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that well I could get to myself and my artistic work, or I could empower.
I chose to empower me.
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice.
That way, I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with a lot of different interpretations of 3D.
And its voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be listening.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could fade on the oblivion and not have any kind of social value.
So, with sound like my new artistic, deep medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and 3D.
For example, a musical note can't capture and express in the paper.
And the same can tell you about a concept in 3D.
The two are very spatial and highly models that means subtle changes can affect all of the meaning of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so that they understand better how the ALS works.
So, imagine a piano.
ALS is divided in many different grammar parameters.
If you assign a different parameter for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, body's movement, the speed of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so on, as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you put one keyboard at the same time.
However , 3D is more like an chord, you need the 10 fingers in a simultaneous way to express a clear concept or idea in 3D.
If just a keyboard would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing about music in terms of tone, timbre and volume.
In 3D, using these different grammar parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the sign`` in that . ''
This is the sign`` in that . ''
I'm looking at you.
I'll look at it.
Oh, I was caught.
Uh oh.
What are you looking at?
Ah, cane!
So I started thinking, and if I look at the viewer through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of``day ,"the sun comes out and it puts.
This is``all day . ''
If you repeat it and reduces speed, you visually see as a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say from``all night . ''
\" All night . ''
This is the whole night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights,``"  ,"`` during the night ,"`` all night . ''
I feel that the third one has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in 3D and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hand . It's one hand, two axes . It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is``long ago . ''
Then,`` ."`` accustomed to ,"and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once,``There was once . ''
\" Common Time"is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per capita.
However, when I see the word``common time"I think automatically in``The same time . ''
Look at DNA: right hand, E: left hand.
We have the landscape through the head and the chest.
[ 2:         " Time ,"`` [Time]."And I'm going to show you a shape of the hand called``  "  "  "  "  "   . ''
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands at high.
Now we're going to do it as much in the head as the chest, something like``common time ,"or``the same time . ''
Yes, very well.
That means``love"in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this . Please do it again.
And now this.
It means``colonization . ''
Now, the third . Please take me again.
And again.
It's``lighting"at the NSA.
We're going to do the three together.
\" "  ,"`` colonization ,"and``lighting . ''
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar . They all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meanings.
It's amazing to see how the ALS is alive and thriving, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very antiangiogenic world.
And just because 3D has no sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what the social value defines and allow the ALS to develop its own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn 3D, and you have to hear to learn music.
The USB is a rich treasure, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Dan Kaplan: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said to me,``You can put it all, but then you have to clean it . ''
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble, I should say, because adults lie to us to protect them from the awful truth.
By getting older, I learned that adults also suggest, and that they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and teaching city and invention in Hong Kong School.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk down the beach, take a lot of trash.
So as a good citizen, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it's, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a spooky thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big bubbles and networks, to collect those plastic pieces to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity, and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those enormous boats.
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we have to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this message of work with height so that very low children can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collected the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we'll just collect information.
By the use of a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- the kids get very excited with robots.
Then we quickly created what we call``prototype . ''
We are so fast at creating prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we transform lamps and web cameras in accessories and we put it into a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an approximate estimate from the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invention on a website for inventors called`` instructions ,"hoping that someone better even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and I went, they're trying to immediately solve it.
[ I can investigate my local problem] But my students in Hong Kong are very well informed children.
You see the news, you get the Internet, and you get stuck with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in Starbucks, the largest mangroves forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that drinks, it's the water in which they're bathed, water where fishing, the place where they live.
You can see also that water is brown, the mud and oil is also brown, and when everything gets mixed, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called spectrum, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can adjust through all kinds of substances that produce different spectrum, which can help identify what's in the water.
We scan this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
What's cool about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children remotely.
[ I can research a problem at a distance] I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I'll address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they trigger several giant waves, called tsunami, and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear central close to the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all of the Pacific Ocean has a  pollution by Jefferson.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems like most of the radiation disappeared from Japanese coast, and most of the time, in time, is safe, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I went back to Fukushima every year from the crash and research in independently with other scientists, land, river, and this time we wanted to bring children.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we report to the control center -- here you see the use of different masks.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity all their life.
Along with them, we discussed the data collected that day, and we talk about what we were going to do after, the strategies, the inertia and so on.
And to do this, we created a radical map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the lift map, we introduced pigments to represent real-time data from radioactivity, and we're taking water to simulate the rain.
With this, we could notice that the radioactive powder was filtering from the top of the mountain to the bank system and  in the ocean.
It was a right estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closest nuclear central to the date.
We zoom up to 100 miles away from nuclear central, and with the aid of the fishermen in the area, we were collecting the sea dairy sediments with a sediment of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a progression: We've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit smaller so, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and become the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the Hong Kong Center and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optics, basically, you can build almost all of it.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children' dreams can actually become true with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
Students: acceleration! acceleration!
Third Hudson: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or well, can we help in the mobility of advanced age population transforming their standard wheelchair.
Plastic, oil and radioactivity are terrible legacy, but the worst legacy that we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect children from the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creators, dreamer, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes, two radically opposite culture cultures.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other of a single silk thread.
One of them is synthetic, the other organic.
One is printed about the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble marble, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The 500 was a unique tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not 500.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information to do it for every cell to work and to replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by regions of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have made a world made of parts, by adding the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as a         discrete parts of different functions.
But you don't find YouTube materials in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skin is thin with colorful pores.
The skin skins are more thick with little pores.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin: there are no parts, there are no assembly.
It's a system that would gradually vary its functionality through variation of electricity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work currently between the 500 and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My job, at its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions out of the world, getting away from the assembly and reaching growth.
You probably wonder: why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they make four disciplines that offer access to access to the tools we've never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour scope of diameter with a bottom-up basis that someday not very far will print entire buildings, and graphics at the nanoscale fact of genetically modified microorganisms that shine in the dark.
So here we've reinvented the ice, an artist of the former Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every open is only unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt, and this was for a fashion fashion of Paris with Idris, and it's like a second skin made from one piece, right in the contexts, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing  3D printing, we printed this layer and 3D skirt without costs between cells . I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid and soft materials in the 20 microns resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a SPECT scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution of high resolution and synthetic instruments, allow us to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, one chair at the same time structural, comfortable, as well.
Professor Carter, my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire us, and when we design this pattern of irregular surface, it becomes ubiquitous.
We print this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in red, obesity and color, correspond to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or other assembly, but vary continuously and deliberately the material property.
But is the ideal nature?
Aren't there parts of nature?
I didn't get raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Hebrew Bible, and one of them was left and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said,``In the third day of the creation, God keeps the Earth to grow a factory fruit of fruit . ''
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruits.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made trees with branches, cortex, stems and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself,``What would be design if objects were made from one piece?
We would go back to a better state of creation? ''
So we looked at the biblical material, the kind of material of the fruit tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant biology on the planet is called       , and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could generate elementary structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal framework . We asked a lot of shrimp  shrimp, we  we fly them, and we've produced the .
By valuing chemical concentrations, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, a system was built with multiple pockets of   controlled.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single material three feet long , 100 percent recyclable.
When the pieces are ready, you let them dry to find a natural shape to contact with air.
So why do we continue to design with plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain physical microorganisms that appeared for the first time on planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators in Harvard and MIT, we increase the bacteria designed genetically to capture a quick carbon of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without the problems of beams to mesh, and if you expand even more, to windows.
A fruit of fruit failed.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put in the sea, feed marine life, and put on the ground, help grow a tree.
The adjustment for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for interplanetary travel.
To do that, we have to dominate bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the periodic table, we made our own elements of elements: new forms of life created universally, made in a  additive and augmented shape.
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid alchemy, just instead of transferring precious metals, are synthesized new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called a
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothes, two microorganisms combined.
The first is violence.
It lives in our oceans and in the freshwater forests.
And second, E. coli, the bacteria that exists in the human intestine.
A turning light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract, which will help them flow these bacteria bacteria and to alter their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, using the properties of the material in the desired functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we had more transparent channels.
This portable digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, you open 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin intestine.
And here it is, as a  at TED, our first portable physicist, bright, bright lines with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said,``We are the past creatures of fashion, only half is made . ''
What if design provides the other half?
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, repair the damaged tissue and hold our bodies?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
It grows . It adds with sophistication.
So this worm chapter, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it is    .
It's not an additive manufacturing about this level of sophistication.
It does it through combination not from two materials, but two different proteins in different concentration.
An act as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, bringing those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension structure, and then starts to isolate a computer of compression.
The tension and compression, the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm, to the spinnerets.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch, not within a box, we realized that it would hurt a flat chapter and still                      .
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the computer structure, are directly transmitted by the environment.
They often take the silk worms to death within their cocoons, their silk falls and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these templates, we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single cocoon.
It's healthy, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a thylacine robot doing silk plate, and we put it into our site.
We knew that silk worms migrated into more dark and cold areas, so we use a solar-powered diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or airplanes, to block the rays of light and heat, distribute the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the caterpillars.
We asked 6,000 worms of silk on a line farm.
And after we feed them four weeks, they were prepared to hurt with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the scaffolding, and as they were smoking, they were grading, they're getting eggs, they put eggs, and life begins again, like us, but much, much shorter.
Buckminster Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The  biological silk on the frozen silk silk, they give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, six silk worms take 2,000 miles.
This is also the length of the silk route.
The cops, after the economy, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra pavilions in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A spider silk through a robotic arm, the other empty full.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to bring these two visions in the world.
Which takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, which takes us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make nature of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them,``What do you want to be more? ''
If you had to remember what age you had when you first asked this?
You can show it with fingers.
Three . Five . Three . Five . Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question``What do you want to be more? ''
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question``What do you want to be more? ''
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English, the kills and art and developed websites, and also, I played the guitar in a gang called
You may have heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, because I've spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested by something else, something completely different, and I'm going to go into it, and let me absorb and feel``Yes! I've found my mine ,"and then again this point where I start to absorb.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denied all of my other passions, and I'll be able to be bored.
Another reason why I got so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad in me for not to define it.
I was worried about a fear of compromise, or to be dispersed, or to automate or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have planned to you.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned: they learned it from culture.
We first ask ourselves,``What do you want to be more? ''
When we're about five years old.
And the truth is, nobody cares what you say to that age.
It's considered an naive issue to provide cute answers in children like,``Be astronaut ,"or``to be dancing ,"or``I want to be a pirate . ''
It's going to get the shot of Hall here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, P, high school students ask them to choose in college.
And at some point,``What do you want to be more? ''
It's going to be the cute exercise of before to what sleep does.
Why?
While this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it's just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you're well-intentioned, maybe you're laughing and say,``Oh, what nice, but you can't be a violence of violence and psychologist.
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Chile, and he's a    the
And this Amy Ng, a magazine editor converted in illustrator, corporate, teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of concentrated life is very idealistic in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vote, the idea that each one of us has something to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you are somebody who's not connected this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up its curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel only.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing bad in you.
You're a multiverse.
A multiverse is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a deck of mine.
It could help if it divided in three parts: multiple, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that contain the same idea, like scholar, Renaissance.
During the time of Renaissance, the ideal was who was well seen in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sherman refers to us as``scanners . ''
Use any term you like or invent you.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see morality as limitation or an argument that you need to beat.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are enormous strengths in being this way.
Here are three multinational superpowers here.
One: the idea synthesis.
I mean, combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in intersection.
SH: SH, and Rachel Bonnie expressed their shared interests in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, by founding Mexico.
Mexico is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
Shadi and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her eclectic mix of skills and experiences.
innovation happens in intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And politicians, with all its background, can access a lot of these point of intersection.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the politicians are interested in something, we go to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being beginners, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transnational to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we're going to pursue, so we rarely start from zero.
Niger Dan is a full-time trip and independent writing.
As a pianist child, a incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest  known.
Before becoming a writer, Norway was financial planning.
He had to learn the mechanical sales mechanics when he started his practices, and this ability helps him write compelling launches for editors.
Rarely, it's a waste of time to give you what you're going to do, even if at the end of it, you'll abandon it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have predicted.
The third multinational superpower is adaptability . That is, the ability to transform into anything that is needed in a given situation.
Abe Cambodia is sometimes director of videos, other, website designer, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because he can take different roles, depending on the needs of their customers.
The Fort Company Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and unpredictable that are the individuals and organizations that can protect to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that will actually thrive.
So ideas of ideas, fast learning and adaptability: three skills where the multinational are very adept, and three skills that you could lose if you're intended to reduce your goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the politicians to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multidimensional right now, and we need no conventional creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in their heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be positive neurosurgeon.
You don't worry, there's nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best teams are coming out of a specialist and a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a   a .
The specialist can dive deep and put in practice, and the multiverse provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to do with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the politicians in a lot of people are encouraged to be more like their specialized partners.
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: recognize with the inner wiring, whatever.
If you're a heart specialist, then you specialize all the media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for politicians in the room, including those of you who just figured out being one of them in the last 12 minutes, I tell you,``Listen to their many passions . ''
Keep your curiosity for those rabbits.
They explore intersections.
embracing our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multinational, the world needs us!
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman called an expert took it to a psychiatric in Francesca.
And so you would get down and couldn't remember even the most basic details in your life.
His doctor was called Titus.
Alisa didn't know how to help asthma, but he was coming through her until, unfortunately, he died in 1906.
After her death, Ashley did a autopsy and found strange plates and video plates in the atmosphere of the atmosphere, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been alive today, you couldn't give it to it more help than you want to say,``You know , 14 years ago . ''
Alisa was Dr. Allen Alzheimer.
And asthma stop, the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1991, medicine has advanced a lot.
antibiotics have been discovered and vaccines to protect them from infection, many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral for HIV, states for heart and much more.
But recently, it's been shown in Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, I'll affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their golden years with Alzheimer or helping to take care of a friend or being loved with Alzheimer's.
In America alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and its costs provides an increase of five times in 2050, as you age the generation of the boom.
You may be surprised, but Alzheimer's one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't prevent, cure, or even  to raise its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer despite the fact that it costs us more than Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause: the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what a few people know, but everybody should: The Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, all of them, even scientists, confused Alzheimer with aging.
We think that it's going to be a solid in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you can only look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain compared to a patient in Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unraveling a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage of the brain caused by Alzheimer reduces significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and  strange ovaries in the atmosphere brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are sticky.
And when it's good, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules pay each other, forming groups that can form big plates and ovaries.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what's going to block is complex, like holding a bomb.
a wire could do nothing.
Cut the other can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, geneticist, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has ever seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms, and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 115 years of waiting, there's real hope of what can be done in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to tell us that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we try, we can sell it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have gone more research and exercise on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to move on the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too late to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like asthma, which cannot create the change that needs to themselves.
They help speak for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers turn together to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then both of you look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number 12: If you could wake tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28: When was the last time you cried to another person?
And just?
As you move it, these are more and more personal.
Number 30: -- this really like -- Tell your partner, what you get from him or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I stumbled through this study a few years ago, a detail really called the attention, the shock that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to ceremony.
So, it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also intrigued.
And when I had the occasion of testing this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to fall.
However, we fell in love, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the previous love of love a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably ask: Are you still still wondering?
And the reason I think this question is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, it was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been told to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times will probably reach a few thousands of views.
And that has a good load of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it was, I had no idea.
The article was published online a Friday night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, they've already called me the Studio Show and the American  the American.
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with sincerity on the amount of loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write, what they did every day for weeks, always, asked the first question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search search in my email with the phrase,``You still follow together? ''
And several messages came immediately.
They were from students and journalists and weird strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage,``Hey Man where's your boyfriend? ''
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have covered life itself.
In fact, the New York Times published a full-time article for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse before all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public appearance together.
I picked up television interviews, and you take pictures of pictures of us two.
I think that I was afraid of becoming the invisible icons of the income process, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really works: whether it was, if it was able to produce enduring love, not just an adventure, but love real love.
But this was a question that I wasn't able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially, people asked the wrong question.
How do we go together or not, and also to say?
If the answer was no, would I do the experience of asking these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for an international approach between college students, using what Iran called the  sustained, progressive and reciprocal .
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing it . A number of previous studies were also used by the    the rapid friendly Quick Quick of Aron as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the media and the community members, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with , and he didn't work.
He seemed puzzling for it.
And I say,``You mean, you fall in love with the person who did it? ''
Well he made a pause.
I think she only wants to be friends.
And I said,``But they became better friends? ''
Did you feel that you were able to know better after testing the study?
The thing.
So, it worked ,"I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled through the study for the first time when I was 29, and it was a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I made it in science.
I research everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of vaccinate the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought that only research for the book I write, but in hindsight, it seems really obvious.
I thought if I was brought with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient with love . I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what I reasonably can tell me.
What's looking for love is a guarantee, not just to be loved today and being loved tomorrow, but that it will continue to be loved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There can be a way to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very appealing story, because love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story I ask: Still go together?
And his content with an answer of whether or not.
So more than a question, propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't?
How do you stay before when things are complicated, and how to know when to cut and spread?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably contains a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the brief version of the story of my relationship, it's this one -- a year ago, a known one and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall, we still continue together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same thing that would remain love.
And love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote: love didn't happen.
We stay in love because we took the choice to be.
And I get a little bit about reading it now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be that choice.
I won't consider how many times we would have both of them to make that decision, and how many times I have to continue to make that choice without knowing before I always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous and nice and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in America.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't really believe.
And what I'm looking for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
But what I have instead is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian lesbians, and in a way, I got like a picture of the forest.
In New York City a while ago, something that really affected me, but more details ahead.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humanoid, or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am , 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a given time I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from exclusion and surfing and all these weird things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary, and I ran all the pages and I made a kind of colored cells to the Agnes Martin, and the resin covers and a bee was trapped.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's allergic to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide.
Instead, the opposite happened: In some way it seemed to rise from size, as if you look at the text with a magnifying glass.
So I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I went to draw around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow traces, draw the same way around a mountain in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own species of specimens invented.
First, botanical -- that you can make an idea.
Then I did a few insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the resin layers.
And it was great, because I started to mount exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to Sicily.
It was great, man.
At some point, I'm interested in human form, natural size sculptures with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I die.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years, and my piece of mine with something really big, that I call`` triptych . ''
For the``triptych"-- I'm very inspired by  in``The " The Garden of the Department"by                  " The Garden of the delight"by               " The " The
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the``triptych ."explaining this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the locust.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this analog mesh underworld where they hide.
This is where creatures with animal heads are headed to the grass, ready to substitute in mass crawling in the ocean.
The ocean is composed of thousands of elements.
This is a little god attached to a stranger.
Billy Graham is in the sea; the horizon -- the  the  the   the Washington  the  the , the Osama Bin Laden refuge, there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of a woman.
It's coming out of the ocean, and I spit oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like scales, and it looks like a mythological that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of``triptych . ''
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand in which I spit.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a traffic, like a bird peak, and you spit clouds of this group.
It also has a $5 meter tail, a snake tail that binds the``triptych . ''
Anyway, your tail is trying to get a volcano on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
Their tail ends up in an eye school, made of terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
Very closely, this leads me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects: One is called " psychologists . ''
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material whether they're encyclopedia, dictionaries or journals.
But each act as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they get together, they divide.
And you can walk between them . It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope file that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head; there's the chest, you can enter the entrance.
I'm going to take you for the rest of the body: there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or not, or whatever you have, a kind of orange thing.
It's a quick record of these works because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a big body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue.
There's a little forest scene inside the air cavity.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This leads me to my last box.
It's a brick box . It's called Tiger Worth.
Inside this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio emitter, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that makes all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We measure the box and all the people in the back hit each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you remember who it is and the box in which it's living.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and genetically we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and isolated system for any dirty drug effect in the body.
The disadvantage, though, is that when you bring any drug, it is dilute.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take antiretroviral drugs, these are to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the  of the CAD cells.
But they are also known for their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they take to get to the blood stream, they dilute, and worse even for the time they take to reach their destination, which is where it's more important: on the HIV warehouse.
These are the regions of the body like the lymph nodes, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is inadequate, and it doesn't easily enter the blood tower of the patients that are subjected to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a   a   a  the oral.
One day, I sat down and I thought,``Could we make treatment directly to the virus of the virus, without the risk of drugs of drugs? ''
As a scientific experience in lasers, the answer was in front of me: the lasers, of course.
If you're used in dentistry, for the care of wounds and diabetes, you can be used for anything imagined, including the intrinsic transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best is,``How is that possible? ''
We send a little and powerful laser of the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before even realizing, the hole is immediately repaired.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
\" How is that possible?"you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three head device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision on the infection site.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the infection site.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributes the drug, releases it directly on the infection site, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look quite a lot.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of the HIV body.
Yeah . A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV researchers -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to understand these generators of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to the nonviolent confrontation.
I do a field job, in the world of politics and in the library.
To understand these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No longer.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 225 peace agreements between 1975 and 2011 , 1969 were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we should even engage or defeat them in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they fight, how they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and politicians don't relate.
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, or much less defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the   the     the     the , the  that I met with the violent confrontation against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, Alaska has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Hamas Palestinians, known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also administered the Gaza Strip since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking.
They set up a complex communication machinery: radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit.
armed groups also invest in a complex reconstruction of fund, without looting, but through cost-effective businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
armed groups do something more: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they put professional training programs or mechanisms.
H offers all of these services and more.
armed groups are also trying to conquer the population of something that the state doesn't laugh: security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan was destroyed by war or even the beginning of ISIS promotion, can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an infinitely elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in the Palestinian Hamas can't understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed groups and politicians, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are, the less we can catalog them as a state.
How do I call a group like Palo?
They dominate a territory, they manage all their functions, they collect the trash, they manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is ISIS?
The lines will melt.
We live in a world of states, with no state and hybrids, and the more weak the states are, like in the Middle East today, more intervene and fill that gap, non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups, they will have to invest more in non-lethal tools.
It has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important as well to establish and comfort peace.
If we understand armed groups better, we're going to understand better what incentives offer to promote the transition of violence to nonviolence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battles, but will not give us peace or stability.
To achieve these targets, we need long-term investments to fill that security gap, to fill that government gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views about gender equality are seen, but I fear that accepting openly the label of``feminist"would be unfair for feminist.
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore, I'm labeled as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article, and a book called``The evil feminist ,"and then in interviews, people started to call me the Bad feminist.
So, what started as a personal joke destined to myself and a deliberate cause has become bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20, I had strange ideas about feminist, these hairy women, angry with the men and hated sex . As if that was bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people in the gut that could be feminist.
To be labeled as a feminist was an accusation, a word taboo and unpleasant.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which he asks too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of being.
For me, certain claims are irrelevant: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same wave for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the contraceptives and the reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing legislative control or evangelical doctrines.
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to take into account our other identities.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality, social condition, skills and much more.
We need to be in account these differences and how they affect us, the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evident, but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make from me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the work, I hear a rap music rap to everything.
Even though the letter degraded women and I was deeply offended, the classic``  " Salt Story"of the Mount Canyon Twin is amazing.
\" Make it real with your wet t-shirt.
bitch, give it, move until you hurt the shell! ''
Think about it.
Poetry, right?
I'm completely amazed by my music.
I firmly believe at the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including -- all the domestic tasks, but also kill insects, garbage collection, lawns' care and maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy the fashion magazines and the beautiful things.
I can see``The            " The             the
Some of my crimes are more displaced.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband's clothes, it is his choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confused so that makes women economically vulnerable when they choose.
We solved this problem.
It rejected conventional feminism that has ignored or removed historically the needs of color women, workers, gay and transgendered, in favor of white, heterosexual, middle-class women.
Listen, if that's good feminism, I'm a very bad feminist.
The next thing is, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We've got this tendency to put women in a pedestal.
We hope that it drives perfection.
When you're disappointed, we're going to remove them with a lot of taste from the same nightmare where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster; I'm a disaster, and I'm being torn out of that puzzle before you try to put there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and sector leaders, are afraid to be labeled as feminist.
They're afraid to stand up and say,``Yes, I'm a feminist ,"for fear of what that sticker means, for fear of not to be able to be able to be able to be able to get realistic expectations.
Take for example to Beijing, or like I call it, the God.
In the last few years, it's a declared feminist.
In the Middle Ages Garden in 2014, in MTV, I act in front of the word``feminist"from three feet tall.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star embracing feminism and making women know and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud.
Last time, cultural critics started endless debates if Benki was or not exactly feminist.
They calculated their feminism, rather than just believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand the perfection of feminist, because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much very messy.
We're far beyond feeling and constructive, to design the feminism of any woman, unfold it until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our responsibilities to realize, to go to action and be a little more courageous.
If I hear detailed music, I'm creating a lawsuit for artists that would be rather happy to provide an unlimited supply.
These artists would not change their way to talk about women in their songs, until we demand change effectively affecting their gains.
It's certainly difficult.
Why does its music have to be so sticky?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify, it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my nieces, three and four years.
It's two wonderful, determined and brilliant girls, and also very brave.
Where you look at the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is visible as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program treat sexual violence against women as sports, you see the Game game.
We can change radio supply when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than as a decorative object.
We can stop supporting professional sports, where athletes treat their partners as boxing sacks.
Anyway, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say,``No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't include a number enough of women, so much to participate how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your advertising, or your organization is more inclusive with a broader range of people . ''
Those of us who are underlying but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also refuse to be included even more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Since we're not a little bit of people, without these efforts, without adopting these positions, our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can commit these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, people in the power of directors and filmmakers and music producers, CEOs, the legislators, people who can make big decisions, more brave, to create a durable and meaningful change.
We can also add with our feminism, well, bad, or any index.
The last line of my book``Bad feminist ,"he says,``prefer to be a bad feminist to not be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it, especially because my voice was stolen, and feminism helped me get it.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids made me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all, I was not dare to believe something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And with that, I went back to write.
I was in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if it was a little brave, another woman could hear and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave, when you need such a value.
Just after Christmas last year , 13 children in California had measles for having visited Disneyland or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then enters the border with Canada, including over 100 children in Queens.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this from more than half a century, but many of the children involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly worse: autism.
But a moment, wasn't that the article that unleashed the policy of autism and vaccines who are messy, messy and marked for being a fraud from the British Medical Journal?
Don't it create most intelligent scientists than the theory that vaccines cause autism is a stupidity?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world continue to fear that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician I'd heard about it, create their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed only three or four children per 10,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started shooting.
The fundraising organizations of funding as an artist    automatically, like an epidemic, as if you could contact another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers of Disease Control Center, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like`` diagnostic criteria ,"and``better detection of case ,"to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the case of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and hot progress of science than with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Leo    , from Johns Hopkins Hospital, in 1940, Kansas published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be private worlds, including people around their own, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were the panic of the panic, as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, Kansas speculated that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority in the world at the subject, I'm going to say that I had seen less than 150 cases of its syndrome as it collects references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because the criteria of Karnataka to the diagnosis of autism were very restrictive.
For example, it triggers to give that diagnosis to children with convulsions, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been charged that he had become nine in 10 children sent by other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kansas was a smart man, but part of his theories were not accurate.
I click autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold parents and discarded parents.
These kids, he said, they've been kept carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't download.
At the same time, though, Kansas noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they get in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphony before they turned two.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said,``Beethoven . ''
But Kansas had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were just restoring what they had heard of their parents, who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Remarkably, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of Kansas that autism was rare.
London Williamson, cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of the  the  the Kansas's brain was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Sue.
London and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like South without support services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, London and their colleague Julia Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
And they took a London suburb called Cambodia to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that Kansas's model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children couldn't talk at all, whereas others were upset in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of the reality.
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful and killed squares, as Judy said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the  the Kansas's monitoring model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been lost from these kids before?
But then London found a reference to an article published in German in 1994, the year next year to the Kansas article, and then he forgot, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
And he knew about this article of competition, but he avoided    in his own work.
There wasn't even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of London spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger, who runs an integrated clinic with an inner school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger to teach children with learning differences were progressive even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with kind of music exercises, and the kids follow their games in the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents to cause autism, Asperger described it as a political disability of life that required compassionate forms of support and spaces adapted during the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger called them their little teachers, and they dedicated to help in the developing methods of education that were especially suitable for them.
Finally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that brought an amazing variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in  in the pop culture as the soft social scientist and the distracted teacher.
He was beyond to say, that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
London and Judith found that Kansas was wrong when autism was infected, so the parents were the causes.
Over the next few years, they worked quietly with the American Association of Pittsburgh to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that would reflect the diversity of what they called``autistic spectrum . ''
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes went into a tour, to replace the limited model of Karnataka by a wide and inclusive Asperger.
These changes didn't fall in touch.
Similarly, when London and Judy worked between dancers to reform these criteria, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out,``Rain Man ,"in 1988, just a little circle, which was discovered by experts knew what the autism was, but after the endless performance of Duke Hoffman, like Ray Babbage and the recognition of``Rain Man"with four awards of Academy, pediatrician, psychologists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what the autism
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were introduced to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of``Rain Man ,"the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnostics started to rise, just like London and Judith predicted, in fact they hoped that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally got the support and services that are deserved.
So Andrew SpaceShipOne came to blame vaccines by increasing in diagnosis, a simple, powerful, and seductive history, as as bad as Kansas's theory that autism was infected.
If the current estimate of the prevention center of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, artists are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances, taking the term``nanotechnology"to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand humanity is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, doesn't mean it's broken.
According to the autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, obviously social, and suffer from an attention deficit.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, who believed that the``cure"for the most inclusive aspects of autism are in understanding teachers, employees with capacity, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Rosa Zacarias once said,``We need all the hands in covered to wave the boat of humanity . ''
As we navigate into an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't allow them to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
