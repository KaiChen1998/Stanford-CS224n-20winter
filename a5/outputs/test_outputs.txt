You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more reading in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can dress it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and never anyone has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that you've got somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epiphany.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bonica.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, in Steve, Ohio where I was the weird of the class.
I was beaten to bleed every week in the kids' bathroom, until a teacher saved me.
She saved my life by letting me go into the teacher's room.
I did it in secret.
It's three years old.
I had to leave the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call of that teacher, the lady Port he said,``I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that we are never going to meet us.
You could come to Ohio, and please bring that man who I know you've found.
And I have to tell you I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to join this please . ''
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We went to see it, we laughed, we cried, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found it a place, we tried it, and we looked at it and we ran out of his family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult came to meet me, it became a box of ash, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking a lot about this today.
It also needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first magnets.
I was amazed.
My heart, fast, I was tired, trying to understand what was in front of me.
I joined my trained around the water, almost 60 meters, and I couldn't think it was about a snowflake on another cup of snow year after year.
The spikes are born when they're dependent on the glaciers or break the ice walls.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are denied and they're clinging up to the end, while others can't support it more and they fall down in a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a iceberg, that are isolated apart and alone, largely as we see us sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a iceberg melts, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts water fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I'm going to photograph these spikes as if it would be the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at these unique moments there are in this way and not going to exist that way again.
It's not death when they melt; it's not an end, it's a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice that I photographed is very young -- it's a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The latest pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that photographed in Kentucky, Greenland.
It's a little bit often to get a rolling iceberg.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts to roll, the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a Greenland iceberg, an average size.
Water of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so no, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one baby . Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about consciousness, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is attached to the X chromosome of the egg.
And, in the other case, the X sperm chromosome joins the X chromosome of the egg.
They both come up and start life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my land activity, I'll make two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a historian of training and what I study in this case is the way people tackle the anatomy -- to say, of human bodies and animals, how they've considered body fluids, the idea of the body, what have thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is an activist, as a patient advocate or, as I say sometimes, impatient advocate of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with similar twins, two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with animation -- much lower people than average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of outliers with outliers, individuals whose physical technology doesn't fit in the male schemes and conventional female.
In general lines, we can call it international.
Interesting adopted many forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the male or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual, with X-rays, whose RISD genes of chromosome and tells the protocols, that we all have in the fatal life, which become testicles.
And then, in the federal life, testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks of testosterone receptors, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of innovation to the Neanderthals.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing a typical female course.
When you're born, the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl . It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breasts, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And after doing it, they realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome and.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, have in the body something called supernormal glands.
They're in the back of the body.
So the supernormal glands produce annoyes, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me consider a typical woman; it doesn't know its chromosomes; I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the organisms.
We produce annoyes and respond to the Neanderthals.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the organisms than the woman who was born with testicles that have the syndrome of innovation.
That's why sex is complicated . It's not that the intellectuals are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised as a man; I had girlfriend, and sex relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy, and he had just discovered that he had ovaries and uterus.
I had an extreme form of a disease known as a super-energy super-energy hypertension.
He had 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus, the supercomputer glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were manipulated, their brain was exposed to the typically male hormone component.
I was born with a child; nobody suspects anything.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by internal menstruation, when doctors found that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of an international case.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as invitations, which is, they have viral tissue wrapped into testicular tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they're dwarf, twins, or international surgery, they get to normal surgery, is not so that we can make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they're attached to several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity; supposedly, being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with categorize.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture in our culture.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individuals.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born as two people within a same body.
The recent recent case is last year with the South African corridor Cameron Semmet, put on the trial of his sex on the Berlin International Games.
A lot of journalists called to ask me,``What are you going to do to determine whether Casey Simon is man or woman? ''
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't take a full line between men and women or men and international women and women, we are we who we are we're carrying that line.
So what we have is a situation in which the more advanced science we have, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable analytical categories that are matched directly with stable identity categories -- are much more diffuse than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows.
So as we see, we get in a rough terrain.
Let's look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to think about in the fact of making them just a few nucleotides?
And as we progress in science, we get more and more in an uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we run probably is too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the numbers of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the fetus.
There are very heated arguments today, maybe not in public, but I know within medicine, when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to go to this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot, they put a feather in front of the nose, and if you moved it still not yet.
If I stopped moving it, you would go.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to face the dilemma to really determine someone's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think this explosion of categories could be helpful to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, I'm defining people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
I'll think these categories are much more unstable than we thought about it.
tense from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm an academic fervent from the founding parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sexist, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I found me every so much looking at that music,``177"and not by the music, which is totally possible.
That's what happened in 1977 with the founding parents.
The founding parents were, to me, the first anatomy activists and explain why.
What they were rejected was an analog concept, and they replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our founding parents were rejected was the idea of the monarchy, the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
Old world monarchs didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power came to the law of blood transmitted from the grandfather to the father, and then the child, etc.
The founding parents rejected that idea and replaced it by a new analog concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the analytical differences . That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of an illustration system where they were spending two things.
The democracy was spending, and at the same time, science was born.
And it's very clear, if we look at the history of the founding parents, that many were really interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were being away from the supernatural explanations, and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power that goes from a variation right of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's god.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence, we were transferred to the idea of analytical coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundation of the future rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happens next years?
And women succeeded.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of the Christmas Rider, who said,``I'm not a woman? ''
We found men in the Civil Rights movement, saying,``I'm a man . ''
Again, people of color who were waiting for the anatomical coincidence of anatomical difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same with the disability movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the coincidence, we have to start to wonder why we keep certain divisions.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomic divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we had to give us to the anatomy.
I don't mean that the five-year-old children had to allow them to have sexual relationships or married.
There are some anatomic divisions that for me make sense and I think we should keep.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both of them in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 in 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in terms: born on March 1 in 1980.
For the fact that we have born three months before Mary is attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other oddities in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered man, though I haven't told you if it's X, at virtue of being considered a man now is possible for the mandatory engine that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, by its part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still persist anatomical categories that in several ways are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could slow down?
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is escaped.
Where are we going?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude,``Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it . ''
But many people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man, you don't have to have chromosome, and that to marry a woman, you have to have chromosome and.
Now, in practice, they don't do chemical tests to people.
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you at the beginning of the insecticity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech``I Have Drama"and offers a solution.
It says we should judge people,``based not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their character ,"getting beyond anatomy.
And I want to say,``Yes, the idea looks very good . ''
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their character?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be based on this to guarantee the rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the groups that they probably deserve more the social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some workers I know can make more informed, intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relationships than I know.
So how do you put the issue of the character content?
It's very difficult.
And one part of me wonder what happens if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, perhaps with MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to guide this stream of thinking to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in democracy, and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like anger, where a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to join a sex change, which case is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins to then separate them, and so they would grow his fame.
But when the phone was asking the reason for the operation of operation, it was a very risky operation, I told me that in that other country, these kids would be very upset, and they had to do it.
And I said,``Well, has the political asylum considered instead of surgical separation? ''
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are without forcing them to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish, I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there can be different ideas coming from different anatomic technologies, particularly if there are people thinking about group.
So for years, since I've been interested in immortality, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women, in average, not all, but in average tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in the grad, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered a feminist, as I was doing a strange plant.
\" Tell me what a feminism has . ''
And I thought,``It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of the gender stereotypes, so there's no female in feminism . ''
But the more I've thought about his question, the more it has seemed to me that there's a female thing in feminism.
That is, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attentive to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, if parents were very attentive to find ways to protect people in part of the state, it's possible to have injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy: think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect link, let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth more than their construction cost.
So we could easily deliver the world tens, maybe hundreds, of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace them by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who would want to live in apartments were already owned, and that the other half would still be missing to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make advantage in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem you're facing is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the forests and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those ambitions.
But you could go to a completely new place, build a whole new apartment building, always, and when the rules of that place facilitate construction instead of putting it out.
So I proposed that governments create new amounts of reform enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name: cities under status.
Later I learned that it's roughly at the same time, Java and Odysseus were thinking about the challenge of Honduras Mongdowscope.
They knew that every year around 75,000 honored honor would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 London, I went through a heartbreaking constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Pepsi Obama was attractive with a platform where he promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked Odysseus to be his boss of cabinet.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection, trial and error and a lot of trials with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their more essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those norms that say you can't go and move all the current apartments of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as rules to progress, and they're usually the rules that prevent us to move.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Java.
They called me.
They said,``Let's give this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December, we got together in Miami, in a conference room from a hotel.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York . Notice, land that, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, Occupy said,``Paul, maybe we could see the TED Talk video . ''
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under alien is a place where you start with property terrain, a charter that specifies the rules that will be applied there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Honduras called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go to Tanaza and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver.
Just this airport covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the honor that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world collapsed.
The public faces were really serious and attentive.
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said,``Professor Rover, thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of TEDTalk.
I have this in my computer . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained how essential that new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also included new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Honduras government would need help of associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that help them establish and make the standards of the status, so that they could all trust the status that the status effectively gets up.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could go easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to encourage their constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special development regions.
In a country that had just passed through this painful crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional email was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the factions in society, supported it.
To include in the Constitution, you have to take twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was approved again in another vote , 141 to one.
Immediately after voting, from 21 to February 24, a delay of about 30 holes went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's being built in South Korea; it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that will allow the administrators to come, and they will allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last bit of the last one for this new court system.
There are urban planners and builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to install in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job; sometimes they're single mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to gather with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to think about building a new city in Honduras?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about how to insist that families can choose among various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my honor friends asked me to say,``Thank you TED . ''
I'm Jesse, and this is my value.
But before you show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession, and that is that I live obsessed with the suits.
I love to find, go, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog, artist, colorful and different for each time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is the second hand of thumb markets and seals of a second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my cartoon in the environment and in my wallet.
I get to meet interesting people; usually my money is going to a good cause; my aspect is unique, and buy it becomes my personal search search.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it from my shop?
I'd like the color?
Would it cost less than 20 dollars?
If all answers are positive, then I feel I won.
Going back to my courage, I want to tell you what I packed for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring with somebody who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I've brought seven indoor clothes, and nothing else.
interior clothes for exactly a week is all I've put in my value.
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after arriving here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in underwear, that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do it, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called bright tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see you for less than 50 dollars.
The whole set, including the jacket, cost about 55, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Monday: color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be bad humor, when you're seeing a brilliant red wetland.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is survival.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you're surrounded from the right people, you won't just understand you, you will also appreciate you.
Wednesday: The child you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the distribution, or I remind them of their seven-year-old little.
I like to smile them and say,``Thank you . ''
Thursday: trust is the key.
If you think you're good with something, it's almost sure you're.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look you can't attract.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth for you: the golden folding leaks go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: developing a very unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came up with this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little valley.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a certain thing.
I don't need to be emotionally supportive to these things, because at the turn of the corner, there will always be another crazy, colorful and bright suit, and if there's a little love in my heart and search.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we used a scale to measure the app of every hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some of these extremes, but I think for most of the integration of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great app in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, and like most of the other experimental physical physicists, we need a lot of logic to match these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them, and then we see how they react, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Certainly intuition that you may have developed with the past of the years is that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, they developed it.
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
He was a little kid, he didn't do it very well, he always fell.
But I bet that the game with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to bring them, and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play parking bars, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics theory.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago, we needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a particle.
But it didn't really fit my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles, and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics superpower.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit . It's right at the center.
And then here we do a pretty good approach to the small metal trade.
What we see is a little little piece of metal, with transportation form, and it's going to be supported in a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I made all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this kind of swimming pilot, which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap, but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up to do those things, because I don't want to bother them, or, actually, scared.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel partners of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that's survival and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We turn the lights off, then we introduced a vacuum and we extract all the air, and then we cooled it into a temperature of less than a degree above the absolute zero.
Now, when you're just on the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly long, I was vibrating, and the way he was vibrating was like a breath like this -- as a force that expands and contract.
And when you give it a soft push, we could make it come and don't come at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a vibrating thing and doesn't come back at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case: all of the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are expensive, and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in instant moments when those are aligned.
In the rest of time, they're disqualified.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is at the same time that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It was worth running in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the scale in scale between one atom, and that metal piece is kind of the same as the difference between that metal piece and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was sliding in space?
There's another part of history.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn the lights up and look inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound risk of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amid.
And 18 months ago, I did another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that is here and allowed me to do it.
It takes me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, I assure it, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is simply explained in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I got a great education of education, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
It's better than show the demo and then explain a couple of interesting things that we've been able to do from their launch.
So, just: we go to Google.
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Uganda Gallery, MoMA, Ethiopia, Riovological, Van Gogh.
I actually will go into one of my favorites, to Metronse, the New York Art Museum.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and, pop, we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay or Michael, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We open up the top plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hallway.
Keep forward . That's fun!
explore.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,``The Cartographing"by Peter Browne in Metropolitan.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the metadata information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the girlfriend technology.
So this image, for example, contains, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me,``What do you get with 10,000 million pixels? ''
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can make it very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be deep.
So I started playing, and I found something that happened there.
And I said,``Wait a moment, this looks interesting . ''
I walked into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I went on a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metropolitan, and I actually discovered that this is a game called [unclear], which is to hit an ocean with a step with a strip of Carnival.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more in deep, and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to leave the image, you'll really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back to MoMA again in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites,``The Star Night . ''
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the brush?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
It goes up and really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is``the star night ,"I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part . It's called``collections . ''
All of you, absolutely all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mansion, that gives the same.
You can online your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we enter, I've created this function that I call``The Power of zoo ,"-- we just made a zoo around.
This is``Emily"at the National Gallery in London.
You can answer things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even not come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to their artwork, and it's properly represented online.
And the big question I'm doing today is,``Do you do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum? ''
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it . Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening to everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a pixel, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that something really interesting about the formula of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
It's a while ago, if you wanted to win a formula of Formula 1, he took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you won the career.
This is what, in engineering, is called a real time system.
It's essentially a system that has two components: a sensor and an accident.
What's interesting today is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter in our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers outdoors.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and activated.
Indeed, the cities are big.
As I noticed, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all these detectors and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from Palestine Antarctic for a year in MoMA, during summer.
It's called``Talk . ''
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk to us.
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and actuators.
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo sculpt the Moses, you say, at the end, he took the hammer, and he got it down to the Moses -- and you can still see a little melody below, and he said,``Am I standing up? ''
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples -- insist in the idea of capturing the environment and setting something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of Pakistan, he had the head.
And anyway, at the end of Italy won.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity happening in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the Uber River.
It's the morning, before play.
The time line is at the top.
On the early evening, there are people over here and there, moving.
It starts the party: silence.
Goliath from France . Golden from Italy.
Entertainment, people do a quick call, and it goes to the bathroom.
Second time . End of the regular time.
First time; second.
City, and at a time, the head.
It won Italy, yeah!!
That night you all went to celebrate the center.
You see the big peak.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the prime minister of the time.
And then everybody goes down.
You see the picture of the place called Circle Massage where, from the room, people will celebrate; it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city's pulse in a way that we couldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection: it's not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today we know all about the procedure of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble.
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were throwing -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of them would be throwing.
And then we put them a little chip, a tag, to the trash, and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
State of Seattle ...
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many innovations in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we think we think is that if we look at every day, the cup that the cup that we throw doesn't disappear, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we take a day still is still there.
That if we show people that, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason of the project.
My MIT colleague, Assembling Buddha, could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zachari.
Everything started with a question of the city mayor, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, add to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, it was: imagine you have a chaos and valves, solid valves, glasses that open and shut up.
It's created as a water curtain, with water pixels.
If you take the pixels, you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Below Mayor.
He liked a lot.
And it creates a commission to design the building to the entrance of the expo.
We call it Digital Water.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you get open, you open up so you can pass.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the wages, you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days always will be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and he said,``Forget the building . ''
No, it's not that they've been demolished, but when it goes down almost all architecture.
Here it is in work.
You see people intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not be able to try to prove the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All of the children in Galapago came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me go, but a building that kept making cuts and water holes, and one had to jump out to not get wet.
( People noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, water pixels, and projects about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appeared in different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a 3D pixel cloud that you can come up with, and go through, and see from very diverse angles.
This is the true controlled Florida, going down to form a V, like before.
When you turn light up, you see this . The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc . .
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Blue, one of the best whale dancers today, the New York Metropolitan star, the New York School, to capture their movements in 3D and use them as an entry for the Flickr.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, the capture in different resolutions.
It's so much 3D digital digitization as a movement capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels, we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for London Olympics.
It's called La Cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as much as a cross of clouds like the grain shell, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody put a little bit of a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time and the Obama campaign, we can go from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions . How do you go from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can upload, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital mite at night, but most importantly, it's going to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for a more accurate, more accurate, faster.
Or maybe you'd like to be in a better way, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves?
How about good health?
Or maybe it's from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What would you like?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
( Audience Member: Creativity .) creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand . Let me see.
A few . It's probably a number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you will choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state?
A little less.
How about longevity?
Oh, most . That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this, the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a profit here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the topic.
The great 20th century of the 20th century, TED . Boston, which was in addition to the Orley Russian Church, wrote a trial called``Nothing in biology makes sense safe to the light of evolution . ''
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: Is it just the past, or the future?
Is it mean to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the one that interests us.
We derived from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 25 different species of hominids.
Some of them have gone back and forth.
We've been here about 130 years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that's used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin, but it's the same protein, chemically indistinguishable, that it comes out of the pancreas.
And talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all carry in the most bacterial intestine than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Damasio puts them out of the highway -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, wet, it's very advertising.
And we're going to provide you all the nutrients that you can want without effort from their part.
It's really like a quick way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some force to the output.
But therefore, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what depends on the future?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or are you going to become something different, maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast discomfort of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief, the animal kingdom, as one and only companies, and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I got to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental: in most of the existence of life, in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when the multicellular organisms appear, things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens, the rest of the body becomes prescription.
In fact, you could say that the inevitable death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student I thought, well, sexual, sexual, death by sex; it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, it had more and more doubt.
I got to understand George Burns's feelings, who still acted in Las Vegas well in his 90s.
And one night someone hits their hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him, it's a magnificent lightweight dancer.
And he looks at it, and he says,``I came in looking for a soup of sex . ''
\" Okay ,"he says George,``I choose the soup . ''
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily counterintuitive, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to keep us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is going to pass the genome into the next generation, adapting and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are like refugee rockets designed to send genetic charge to the next orbital level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen expressed when he said,``I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to make it not dying . ''
Evolution does not necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or strongest or faster and even the smartest.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, the professional bacteria that can survive the heat of the smokers that would produce, if there were fish there, fish cooked in the vacuum, yet they've managed to make it a advertising environment.
So what does this mean, when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if you look forward, to the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and eliminated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've made our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we migrated, and we are so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation to happen.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of traditional, natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're innovative.
And in the isolation: when as a species of distant planets are going to exist isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in natural ways.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive, intriguing possibility.
I call it a negotiation, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what's chosen at the individual and family level.
They also think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not just the sex of its offspring, but in your own body, make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could make genetic change to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the puzzle?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in their genes?
If you look at the future, those kinds of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and demand 13 years.
It cost 2,300 million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a close cost at $20,000, and in a week.
It won't be very much to be done for the human genome for $1,000 and more and more to the scope of all.
Those changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe or not there is an experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the tobacco?
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine only other two little changes.
Can you change the cells of their bodies, but if you could change the cells of your offspring?
What if they could change the sperm and the eggs, or change the full figure, and give your children a better opportunity of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate the hemisphere, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children healthier?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt hypotheses -- a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have a faster contribution muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irresistible.
And when we're in conditions of taking this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before in the neocortex.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better, more successful, more successful society?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: are we going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit wisdom needed to make these decisions wisely?
For good or bad, and before what I might think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor click, click, click.
clarity, click, click, click . It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in the 12th . .
It was the only one who could talk to the flight assistants.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said,``No problem . We probably hit some birds . ''
The pilot had already fixed the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot links the airplane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
I turned out the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and no noises.
And then three words.
The top three words I've ever heard.
He said,``Get ready for the impact . ''
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror . Life ended.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to repair, all the experiences I wanted to have and never had.
As I thought about that later, I came up with a phrase, which is,``collects bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we were avoiding the George Washington Bridge, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big weigh.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry the time I wasted in things that don't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a medium in that, I decided to eliminate negative energy in my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about wonders.
I don't try to be right; choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes out,``15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water opening.
I'm saying,``Please fly . ''
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documentaries.
And as we go down, I had the feeling of, wow, die no fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness would be made in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- still . And I scream, like a little one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I understood, by connecting those two points, the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
On most of all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
I get a miracle, not to die that day.
And I got another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and back and living otherwise.
You're flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, how do you change?
What do they do, you still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever?
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy on them?
And most importantly, are the best parents who can?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked in was for this guy.
The guy is called Tennands.
Texas was one of the most important graffiti of the 1980s.
And one day he came home after running and said,``Dad, I feel an antenna in the legs . ''
And that was the beginning of the ALS.
Today Texas has total paralysis.
It can only use your eyes.
Her work influences me.
I have a design firm and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to talk about Tony, Texas, and his cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said,``We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with him? ''
And his brother said,``I just want to talk to Tony again.
I only want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me . ''
And I said,``One second, doesn't I see Stephen Hawking, isn't all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices? ''
And he said,``No unless you're some important, and you have a very good insurance, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said,``Well, how do you communicate then? ''
Anybody see the movie``The Scarvation and the butterfly"?
They communicate that way -- they're running with your finger.
I said,``That's archaic . How can it be? ''
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead I signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how he was going to cover.
He engaged me with his brother and his father there at the moment,``All right, this is the deal: Tony's going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make its art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner can't communicate . ''
So I talked at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called Globe Research Lab, who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and so with a laser pointer, they draw on that and register the negative space.
So go around doing art installations like this.
All the things that appear, they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First they start with the sex organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations.
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization, and very much to move things around we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that texting could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing; I call it``Indian"because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say,``I don't deserve . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers around the world literally from all the corners of the planet to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conservatives and conservatives took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and that when we came back, they would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place would have graffiti.
But for two weeks we program, we went to the common country, my son was part, my dog, and we created this.
It's called West, and you can see the description.
It's a couple of cheap sunlight glasses that we bought in the shipping country of the Beach Beach, some copper wire and Homo Department and Radio Shack.
We take a PMS camera, we open it, we cut it on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- it builds yourself; we published the free code of software down in a free way.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says``no . ''
There's no hospital that can say``no . ''
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the Texas room.
I love this picture because this is another person's room, and that's his room.
There was all this biomass, and I went down during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so he could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the hospital outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you would imagine what the feeling was in parking.
The funny thing was that we had to fire in the parking, so we felt as if we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what said,``This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and someone finally came to rescue me, and I would get out of there so I could breathe . ''
Isn't it wonderful?
And in a way that's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way for this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the guy,``Oh, this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweeted something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all this -- and this is what ends up closing the circle is that in April of this year in the Gulf of MOOCs in the center of Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called``Art in the streets . ''
And``Art in the streets"is going to have the best examples of urban art, Brunology Farming, CDC, all of them are going to be there.
Texas is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the Electric nothing was possible at some time.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with occasional recognition technology; I just recognized something, and I was associated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we have to do . If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting in general situations, and at the same time a lot of dangerous.
I went to jail -- hard.
I worked on a coal mine -- dangerous.
He filmed in areas of war -- hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been diving in deep appearance situations with the only goal of trying to try and examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully, to analyze them in a way that they look entertaining and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk over the world of brands and the sponsors, I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a plane in eBay.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered in sale the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the next thing:``United States NGOs present: my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is, and as a content, could exploit it in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when I do it.
But said this, it's a very good media opportunity . ''
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So still, I knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working in, we look at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate, for something as hard or as dangerous as to enter rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Sputnik: I want to make a film that's about the production of products, marketing and advertising, and that all of the film is funded with production of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call``The largest movie ever sold . ''
What happens in``The largest movie ever sold"is that everything top-down, early at the end, has brand images, all the time, from the self-assembly that appears before the title, brand X.
Now this brand, California Stanford, the State Center ...
These people are going to be associated to the performance of the performance forever.
And so the film explores all this idea . (Michael Kahn: It's reduced .) MK: It's reduced.
I'm a redundant staff . (MK: I just say it .) It was more for emphasis.
It was``Perspective . forever . ''
But we're not just going to have the X-ray of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure we get all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you've used ...
The most cool car that you've been driving in``The largest ever sold ,"the best trick you've been drinking,``The largest movie ever sold . ''
17 Kolad: The idea is, then, besides showing the brands as part of life, making them finance the film? MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The entire film goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, the whole film, from principle to end.
And I would love that CEO will help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
Guy: However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be.
TK: You have a perspective -- I don't know if``angle"is very negative, but you know how it's going to repeat?
MS: A million and a half . (DC: All right .) John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard with them, but surely it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
DK: Who knows, perhaps for the moment that we're going to see the film, we look like a lot of joyful idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Rudewalk: Most of the answers will be``no . ''
MS: But will be hard to sell it, by the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS :...means you're not very optimistic.
So, you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Okay . (MK: Okay .) Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yes.
MK: We have some places where to go . (MS: Okay .) Turn out the camera.
MS: I thought,``Turn out the camera"meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
It turns out the camera means``We don't want to know anything about your film . ''
MS: And that was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed; I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, making so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old means and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell that new data worthy of attention that's going to take the message to mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a wood error, and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents.
See, when you look for transparency images in Google, it comes -- this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way of rolling, Sergey Brin . No.
This was the problem: transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen -- easily understandable, which is characterized by the visibility or accessible of information, especially in business practices -- the last line perhaps the largest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians will name it, the president, the name, even the CEO.
But suddenly when it comes to making it reality, it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day -- like that weird bear that still continues to regenerate.
It's unpredictable -- like this rare road path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it risky?
You'll eat an entire bowl of Cool White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said,``No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story . ''
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as I used to say,``Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story . ''
You see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanted to help me -- and just because I knew John Bond and Richard Kidol of many years later, I realized that I would have to go to my own, I would have to take into the environment and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to have suddenly -- what I started to realize is that when you start to convince companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant films, others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies, giant, say that the reason their films are so successful is due to the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say,``Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies? ''
And the film is called``The greatest movie ever sold . ''
How are we going to see B specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm to go out, every time I open my button, you'll see the Band desert.
At any time during an interview with somebody else, I can say,``Are you really cool for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there I offer one of these fabulous arms.
Both``Florida Force"as``Paradise winds"is going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a woman -- solid, bold, in bars, whatever.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a central view.
Karen Frank: We are a small mark.
So similar to the kind of smaller movies you said, we're more a kind of a brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So, doing things like this, you know, I'll remind people, the reason why this is interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe B?
Man is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: upper technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the armpits.
Man: We talk about something audacious, fresh.
I think fresh is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus``combat the smell and the sweat . ''
It keeps you fresh.
How do we keep you fresh? With better freshness, more freshness, three times more fresh.
Things like those who are holding the benefits.
MS: And that's a billionaire company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the street man, the people like me, to the commons.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand?
Man: My brand?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: Reverse the '80s, punishment ,' unless it's a laundry . ''
MS: Okay, so what's the Jerry brand?
Jerry: Something unique . (MS: One .) Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a dark galaxy.
I really like dark colors, many gray and things like this.
Usually I carry accessories like sunlight glasses, or I like the crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a classic conversation, Merces Benz.
Man 2: The brand that I am, I'll call it a casual flight.
Woman 2: In a hippie part, it's part of the yogurt in part of the Brooklyn Brown, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
selling toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I get the market.
Man 5: Marco cranica failed.
Is that something?
lawyers: I'm a lawyer . .
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often rank at the intersection of dark glamour and a fluke.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the``market personality . ''
And I found a company called Olland Zalicon in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Nest, February, Salam to discover that personality of brand.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Abdication: Do photos, right?
MS: Yeah . The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are originated, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is the best day of my life.
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be.
I like different things.
I like weird things . I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about``why"-- why do that serve us?
What's the male? What phase is you now?
Why is it important to reboot? What the red represents?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you had?
It doesn't have to be afraid . What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: Ow!) Thank you . No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience . (MS: Great work .) A: Yeah . (MS: Thank you very much .) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linus Zaleild: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complementary, in your brand personality -- the Morgan Sputnik brand is a conscious brand.
They're very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or elsewhere instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be the human nature to avoid the things that they're not sure; they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them all the time, and you get something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are they?
The first one here is the classic, Apple.
And you can also see here to Target, Wii, minister of Mini Cooper and Below.
Now there are legal marks and conscious brands, those things that have gone and come, but a legal brand is quite powerful.
MS: A presidential brand . What's your brand?
If someone asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would be be?
Are you an architectural attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you a descending attribute?
A little bit more calm, reserved, conservative?
Astronomic attributes are like being a playful to be fresh like Prince, contemporary, adventurers, attacked or audacious like Europe Flickr, fast or agile, professional, dominant, magic or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you a lot of descending attribute?
Are you conscious, like 70,000?
Are you a traditional, traditional, suppliers, protective, , do you identify with Oprah?
Are you trustworthy, stable, family, reliable, safe, sacred, contemplative or wise, like the Dalai Lama or the yo-yo?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, astronomers and offspring, who said,``No ,"they didn't want to make part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control on the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the narrative, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and film.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned the outdoors.
In the entire city for the last five years, there are no fences, no posters, no steering, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing road in schools with liquidity problems in America.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or where I've been more successful that I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They took the intermediary, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did you go? Did they succeed?
Well, since the movie are in the Fundrines of Sundance, let's take a look.
According to Burroughs, the movie are in January, and since then -- and this is not all of us have had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covered just a period of two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The film is still not distributed.
It's still online . It's not in Stanford.
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not wrong, because almost all of the agencies that we talked about, they advised their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you risk, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that, it's pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees in the risk to the risk, it's preparing all your company to lack rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to risk.
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that can scare them.
Ultimately, moving, I think we need to give birth to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We embrace fear . We embrace the risk.
From a cockroach at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to beat transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk``embrace transparency ,"has been presented by my good MRI friends, who $7,100 bought the rights of the name in eBay.
EM: It converted great data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
Now,``We embrace transparency . ''
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those $77,000 dollars?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket, I have a letter to the name of the TED matrix organization, the Sapling Foundation, a ship for $7.7 to be applied to my TED TED assistant.
The idea behind the Stirling IT worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium management plant in Namibia.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we're able to compromise these systems that control speeds and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software; they are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Windows in a laptop computer used by an engineer to make this gray box, then we're ready.
Here's the plan behind Stuxnet.
We started with a Windows speaker.
It's lived in the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is demanded; it's accomplished . .
Is it easy, eh?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started investigating about Stuxnet six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of Windows: the speaker used multiple damaged vulnerabilities.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with Stuxnet, and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very strange things.
Stuxnet behaved as a lab rat that he didn't like our cheese: I wave it, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing with different cheese tastes, I realized, and I thought, this is a targeted attack.
It's completely targeted . ''
The speaker is actively looking in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
If no, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought,``We don't know what the goal is . ''
It could be, say, for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We better discover the goal soon.
So we went out and we developed the attack code, and we discovered that it was structured in two digital bombs: a little little one.
We also saw that they were very professional armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the dots that I would attack.
You can probably even know how much it takes the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Stirling speaker is complex and high technology, let me tell you: charge is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old local language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we looked for at the beginning was called the system functions, because we know what they do.
We then looked for people and data structures and we tried to relate them with the real world, with objective potential potential of the real world.
We need the theories that we can approve or waste.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent salary, it has to be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been reported.
You don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of Bush and to the Namibia management plant.
So I told my assistant,``Give me a list of all the experts in cells and energy plants between our clients . ''
I called them, and I got them in an effort to connect their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital view with the control of the robot.
The rotor is that cell phone inside the centrifuge, that black object you see.
If you manage the speed of this rotor, you can certainly break it and even make the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow, and they're going to dive into an effort of effort to get crazy to maintenance engineers, so they couldn't solve this rapidly.
We're trying to decipher the big digital view looking very closely to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number hundred steps in that code, you can't forget.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these celessions are built in Namibia, and found that they're structured in what's called a waterfall, and every waterfall contains 164 inches.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These infrastructure in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code?
An almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had among hands.
So it didn't be wrong.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
We routinely ended up with no exit, and we had to start.
And yet, we found that both digital arrangements were pointing to one and same goal, but from different angles.
The little little girl is taking a waterfall, and making the robots turn and relative, and the big view communicate with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In addition, we're very confident that we have determined what the drug is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Nature.
We shouldn't worry that other targets are achieved by Stuxnet.
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and you see the centrifuge.
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake data data are published by Stuxnet.
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the theft, the security camera is a video feed.
Is it great?
The idea here is obviously not just breaking the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to build a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbines is going on, you have to open escape valves in a millisecond.
Obviously, this cannot make a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're engaged, then bad things can happen.
The plant can explode.
And the operations or the security system will notice it.
That scares.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this . This is a generic attack.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centers, with uranium management.
It could also work, for example, in a energy plant, or an automotive factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have -- as an attacker, that I'll design this burden with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use worm conventional technology to disseminate it.
It's more possible.
And if you do that, with what you end up with is a massive destruction cyber.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph, it's been public in many sides that people assume that the Moses is the main amount behind this.
What's your opinion?
Ralph Langla: Okay, do you really want to hear this?
Yeah . OK.
My view is that the Moses is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber superpower.
There's one one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately.
Because otherwise, our problems would be even bigger.
CA: Thank you for letting me . Thank you, Ralph.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take, and you give them a humanitarian skills, or another one that makes you users of wheelchair users go up and walk back.
In``Berkeley Bionics"called these robots, exoskeletons.
They're nothing different from something that you put in the morning, it gives you a big force, which also increases your speed, and help, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other external beings.
This is not an unreal idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier that, on average, has to take on its back, a 45 pounds load, and you're demanding it even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you the HIV/AIDS -- or Port Carta.
Soldier: With the HIV exoskeleton, I can cover 90 pounds by variable land for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to be able to drag and execute movements with great agility.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my strength and my resistance.
Edith Berry: We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new exoskeleton, this year.
So it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the wheelchair users, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people about it, in wheelchair chairs, around the world.
One percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the vertical column that when they start their life -- at the age of 20 , 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that you get to be rapidly multiplying.
His only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some complexity -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful emergence, as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you the ELA3S who is using Amanda Boston who was 19 years ago had a lesion in the vertical column, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Baker: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our ELA3S, I mentioned.
It has a few sensors.
completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the computer on the edge, here in the back.
And also there are some batteries that give energy to the motors in the hip, and in the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very natural gait.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down was paralyzed.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and everything moving down.
A little bit later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said,``Amanda, you'll never walk back . ''
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last piece of hope of my self.
The adaptation technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to slow down in skis, climbing rocks and even riding in a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of wheelchair users, everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the baton, practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Middle Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo forests.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis in this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, terrifying things, the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not observed.
Unfortunately, the bonobos are the least understood of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the plankton itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has been proposed for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War . .
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat trade of hunting and deforestation makes you not filling or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter mixing the trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the apes,``do love, not war ,"because they have frequent, promiscuous sex, promiscuous and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity since the life of Bonobos is more than the Amazon Surrouslan.
Bonobos, like humans, love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us, and for them, the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage tolerance.
With him, we learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, behavior diversity, connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots itself of laughter, dance and human ritual.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild medium.
First of all, it's a block of blue style, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a chase.
Look what she's doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase:``I have it from the balls . ''
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common in Bonobos and humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play like testicles and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun thing.
But play is political.
The game is political, it can adopt many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe the place where the awe is required.
And I want you to see -- this is Furby, a young female, who's playing with drinking water.
I think, like, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to an increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our adaptation of adaptation.
To adapt successfully to a world that we have to play.
But would we leverage the maximum of the game?
The game is not frivolous.
The game is essential.
For Bonobo and humans alike, life is not just cruel and ruthless.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, it can be the moments in which it is the most urgent.
So, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as a captain assistant in a volunteer fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers are very highly skilled, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still there was a race on foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was standing in a conversation with the owner that certainly was going through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in plain night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a umbrella, in pajamas, down, while his house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I, let me call it Lex Luther came first to the captain, and this asked him to go into and save the dog's dog.
The dog! I was so jealous.
There was a lawyer or a money management that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I walked into a building building to save a living living only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an alternative.
He said,``Bezos, I need to get into the house.
I need to go up, go back the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes . ''
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I went on -- I went up the stairs, at the end of the hallway, I went to the real firemen, and that height kind of had finished the fire and entered the front room in search of a couple shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back down the ladder where I met my Namastakers and the beautiful dog in the front door.
We took out of the house the treasures for the house of home where, as it was to expect, his treasure gets much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of the house, grabbing them through the brave effort demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about the other was that somebody had reached a couple of shoes.
So much in my voice in Robin Hood, as in my voice as a volunteer fireman, I am witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also from grace and courage.
And you know what I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or they're to achieve, remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you of: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give it right now.
They serve food in a dining, clean up a neighborhood park.
Be mentors.
We're not going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's lives.
So go into the game; save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1968 with a very simple idea: cement modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LIGO came up with this.
It was called a automatic assembly brick.
And in a few years, LIGO bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that you have made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LIGO made it accessible.
LIGO simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and made it a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell Labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows a lot bigger and more complex circuits, a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Liberia.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little bits are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're predicted to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they are together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the output, the blue is the current, the pink is the entrance and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a regulators.
If we change the button by a pulse module, which is here, and now we have an intentional light.
We added this timbre to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, literature are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and sound, Liberia allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it blink faster or slower, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind literature is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to reduce ready bricks to use.
lights, sound, solar panels, motors; everything must be accessible.
We've given Liberia to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a night works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also taken limits to design schools.
So, for example, the designers without any electronic experience start playing with Liberia as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and peaks, we have Georgia creating ...
( metallic sound) A few weeks ago, we took Liberia to the Rhode Island School Design School, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said,``Do something . ''
Here's an example of a project that you've done, an active cannon cannon.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a locust made of Play-Doh that's afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, literature became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of them.
So literature has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and invent.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company looks to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm . Wait for a moment.
You can delay a little bit in charge.
We can -- we can continue to let the video better.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm a time later?
Okay . Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything you're supposed to stop; we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called Cold for America, and it would be like some Peters of Peace for technologists.
We select some members every year and we put them to work with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them into the wild world.
They made great applications; they worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
They meet Al.
It's a city hydrant in Boston City.
So here it appears as if you're looking for a quote, but what I really looks for is somebody clean it when you're trapped by the snow because it knows that it's not very good at stopping fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this unique way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of County for America . ''
They were there in February, and at that point, a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleans these hydrants.
But one of the members called Erik Michael noticed something else: that citizens cleaned with sticks the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a hydrant.
You accept it when you snow.
When you do it, you put a name in this case, in this case.
If you don't do it, somebody can reproduce.
So it's got a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 scheduled applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it spreads in viral form.
A responsible of the city of Honolulu City when you saw this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt signals of tsunami.
It's very important to work these tsunami whistles, but people are stealing the batteries.
That's why I ask the citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens take away the layers.
And Chicago just launched it to make people register to clean up when they snow.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use.
And this has spread without friction, organic and natural.
If you know a little bit about government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working in a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that we had done it for normal channels, it would have taken at least two years, and it was two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that the moment has cost two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every government level.
So an app that shows you in a couple of days and spread in viral form is a kind of warning shot to the institution of the government.
It suggests the better ways of working, not as private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
It's also not as a technology company, but rather like the Internet itself.
That is, without restrictions, open and generative.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents how to address the question of the government that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an advanced institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only Coke for America, but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given with the government.
They feel a big frustration to that, but they don't complain, they fix it.
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the DVD and all those other things that get crazy, the government is essentially in Tim Obama's words:``What we do together because we can only don't . ''
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to remember it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change; the government itself.
And because the government at last demand of us -- remember that from``us, the village"-- the way to think about it affected the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government consists in choosing people to take charges.
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, matter of rates.
This is the phone attention center of services and information.
It's the place that you have called the calls if you mark 311 in the United States.
Scott held this call.
I joined``Zarina"in the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing . It started with animal control.
And he finally said,``Hey, can you open the door doors, put a strong music and see if you go? ''
And it worked . So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the rates.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app, web and mobile, called Content Conservation . ''
We don't program that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the Bureau of New Boston urban mechanics.
One day, this really happened, it comes up with this request:``Gardening in my trash cube ."I don't know if it's dead.
How do I take it? ''
The dynamic City dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Constitution County, it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said,``I got closer to the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
Do you? Yeah . Live? Yes.
I went back the cube . I went home.
Good evening, sail candy . ''
Pretty simple.
This is great . It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of governance as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So, a citizen helped another, but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And you could have connected to the government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we make communities.
If we call the animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entrance to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader? Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfying our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the surface layer of 15 centimeters.
Underneath is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps it to us that we finance as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sensual.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the Oscarder movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed report from 125 pages in response to the Second Association project on the financial reform project.
That's not political activity, it's bureaucratic activism.
And for those of us who have been resistant to the government, it's time that we ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in all of them?
We cannot be able to get government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to replicate the function of governance so that it can expand the civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act, and you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years like me, at registeres, I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face what's going to talk about; they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do it.
So when you face the government problem, they don't care much much to make their voices.
They're using hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a hydrant, carrying weeds, dumping a garbage cube that has a gallery inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrocarbons and many people.
But these applications are like digital reminder that we're not only consumers, we're not only government consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the citizenship.
So I want to ask all of the present, when is the important things that we have to do together, all together, will we be a crowd of voices, or will we also be a humanity of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails, prisons and in death row.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus stimulations have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here has impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here's fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, and if it's charitable, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a matrix, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She started a lot of the decisions in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over 1800.
She was born over 18,000 and her experience with the slavery, the way he saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also loving.
When I was little, and I looked at it, she came up and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong I could barely breathe, and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I went back to look at it, he came up and said,``Brian, you still feel my hug? ''
And if I said no, I would grab me again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the under 10.
Occasionally, when I was going to spend a while with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room, and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 minutes, she stood up, went back to the room, took me out of my hand and said,``You see Brian . We're going to turn them out . ''
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
She took me out and said,``Brian, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody . ''
I said,``Okay, Mama . ''
She said,``Now make sure you won't do it ."I said,``Sure . ''
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said,``I want you to know I've been watching . ''
And he said,``I think you're special . ''
He said,``I think you can do whatever you want . ''
I'll never forget it.
Then he said,``I just want you to promise three things, Brian . ''
I said,``Sure, mama . ''
And he said,``The first thing I want you to promise is you always want your mother . ''
He said,``She's my girl, and you have to promise that always the caring . ''
As I took my mom, I said,``Yes, Mama, I'll do it . ''
And then he said,``The second thing I want you to promise is that you will always be right, although the right thing is . ''
I thought about it, and I said,``Yes, Mama . That's what you're going to do . ''
Then, finally he said,``The third thing I want you to promise is you never drink alcohol . ''
I was nine years old, and I said,``Yes, Mama, you'll do it . ''
I grew up in the field, in the rural south . I have a brother for a older year and a sister a year.
When I was 14, one day my brother came home with a six beer package, I didn't know where I pulled them down to my sister and to me and went for the forest.
We've just got the crazy madness.
He took a beer sip, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said,``No, no, no . All right . You follow, but I'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said,``Come on . Today, you do it . And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said,``No . I won't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me.
He said,``What happens? Take a beer . ''
I kept my gaze with strength, and I went,``Oh, it won't be you still thinking about the conversation with breast . ''
I said,``But what are you talking about? ''
He said,``Mama tells all the grandchildren that are special . ''
I was broken.
I have to admit something before you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread widely.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a virtue; I say it by the power that identity has.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't see meaning.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoners during the ban.
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to engage.
Now, I'm trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in probation freedom.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor, black communities, it's so much challenging, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black ones between age 18 and 30 is in jail or in probation.
In urban communities all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the color young people are in prison or a condition.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilt, it's wealth.
And it seems that we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and the face make us believe that these are not problems.
We're disconnected.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work a few curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, they provide you rights forever if you have a criminal conviction.
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as elevated as it was before you would expect the law to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they're sentenced to 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility to go out.
Right now we're in a process of some litigation.
The only country in the world.
It represents people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
So, in some sense, you've been taught to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the committed creatures?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way of looking at it: it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of every nine executed people, it's identified one that is innocent that is extended and released from the death of death.
An error rate, amazing, an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation, it wouldn't be allowed to be allowed to release airplanes if in every nine you would wake up, you would have to star.
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction, and it lasted to World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being linked.
They worried about being bombed.
The threat of terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who are approaching me, and they say,``Mr. Stevenson, you talk, you do speeches . Tell people to stop saying that in our history, they stop saying that in our history, we've been dealing with terrorism, after 116 . ''
They ask me to say,``No . I say we grow with that . ''
The age of terrorism continued, obviously, with the segregation and decades of racial supermarket and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood what we historically have done.
And all the time we're hitting each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflicts.
We're working to talk about races . I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial segregation without a engagement with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving conferences on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said,``You know, it's good worrying what you say . ''
He said,``We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can never have it here . ''
The room stayed in silence and a lady said,``There is no way with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately, we were going to run people . ''
Think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, execute people, especially if they were in most Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't worry about these very difficult issues, positive, wonderful things are, however, involved.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated technology . We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are embedded by suffering, abuse, degradation, marketing.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We lately talk about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that's going to spend more time thinking and talking about poor, wildlife, who will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that is inside of us.
It's true that we need to believe in issues we haven't seen.
That's how we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual.
With creativity, the development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas also for the heart convictions.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not only brilliant and dazzling, but also dark and hard.
Valley Hall, the great baby leader, talked about this.
He said,``When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression, we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in species of despair and being witness . ''
Well, that orientation for spirit is practically in the heart of what I think, that still in communities like TED, has to be engaged.
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, exclusion, inequality, injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
So let's find them back.
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer, to meet Rosa Parks.
These women get together just to talk.
Occasionally, Mr. Carter called me, to say,``Brian, it comes the Park Park . We're going to meet to talk.
Do you want to come and listen? ''
I said,``I know lady . I do want . ''
So she said,``Well, what do you do when you come? ''
I said,``Listening . ''
So I was going and just listened to them.
It was very virtuous, very enlightened.
And in an occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks was headed to me and said,``Now, Brian, let me give you this idea of egalitarian justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do . ''
And I started giving it my speech.
I said,``Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We're trying to help those who have been convicted.
We're trying to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice.
We're trying to end up with the feelings of life, without parole freedom for children.
We try to do something to death penalty.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We're trying to end the massive incarceration . ''
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at the end, and he said,``Mmm me . ''
And he said,``You'll end up exhausted, really exhausted . ''
At that time, Ms. Face was included, I put my finger in the face and said,``That's why you have to be very, very brave . ''
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately the humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing we've made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure that if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not like a thief.
Even if someone kills another, it's not a murderer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very slow, very stimulating, is not going to judge us by our technology, by our designs, or our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end you judge the character of a society, not the way they treat rich, powerful and privileged, but by the way they treat poor, the doomed, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel despaired . I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I'm tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been sentenced with a lot of hard.
I go to jail and I see my 13 and 14 clients, who have been statement to be judged as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what it is?
The judge is the ability as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late, I was awake thinking -- by God, if the judge can become something you're not, you should have magic powers.
Yes, Brian, the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working in a matter.
I had a 14-year-old client, a little, poor, black.
I started working in the action, with a look that said,``You know, Mountain for my 14-year-old black client to be treated as a 75 year-old privileged, executive of a corporation . ''
In the middle, I set out that there had been behavioral behavior, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an active line on how in this country there's no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
Now, the next morning I woke up thinking about that inspired action would be a dream, or did I really write it?
For my horror, I didn't just have it, but I had sent it out.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and I felt really overwhelmed, overwhelmed.
I went on the car to the judge.
I thought this would be very hard and very beautiful.
I finally got out of the car.
I was climbing the stairs when I came up with a larger black man, and he was the county of the court.
When he saw me, he came up and said,``Who is you? ''
I said,``I'm a lawyer ."He said,``Is you lawyer?"I said yes.
So I'm approached and hug.
And I got scared in the ear.
He said,``I'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was a very variable.
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
By the way, the judge saw me.
And he said,``Mr. Stevenson, you write this sweat? ''
I said,``I know Mr. I was ."And we started discussing.
People started coming . They were all outraged.
I was the one who had written those crazy madness.
The cops came up with the assistants, the authorities.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all furious because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the yellowfin of the eye, he agreed to see the consensus he was going and came.
I looked around the window, and I was able to hear all that scream.
I kept walking up here and there.
Finally, this old black old black, in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge decided a recipe.
And during the rest of the curriculum, it was offered because the consensus had entered the room.
The assistant was sent on the old black old black.
And he said,``Jimmy, what do you do in the audience room? ''
And the old black stood stood up, looked at the assistant, looked at me and said,``I entered this audience room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with signed . ''
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity have to be able to rise to freedom, compassion and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the target.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You've just heard and seeing an obvious desire of the audience, from this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a check . What can we do?
Bess: There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be this spring in which you're going to make an effort to bridge the funds that are spent today in punishment policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this , 46 percent of homicide cases don't conclude in arrest.
56 percent of rapes don't get to anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are destroyed to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's told that it has to do with the biggest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who think it is?
Bess: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not by violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why there's this dramatic increase in the prison population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric rhetoric.
We have three legal causes to bring people into perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than making those resources back to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brian, you've been excited today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED . Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, and they could carefully be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the press means prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing care of us more than surviving, the first stop of all of that data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
It was order and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So that's why we're going to prefer to look at the negative.
That old one of the press,``If there's blood, sell ,"it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for seven days in the week , 24 hours a day, it's not surprising that we are pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Perhaps, in change, what really happens is we get distortion.
Perhaps enormous progress in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, species extinction, water scarcity and energy; we certainly have them.
As human beings, we are very good at embracing problems, and in the long way, we end up with them.
So let's look at the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than doubled, the average income per capita per capita in inflation has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we keep getting higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefine the meaning of poverty.
Think about it today in America today, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, bathrooms, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, conditioning air and cars.
The maggots of the fall of the past century, the empires on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
To support a lot of this is technology, and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes into information technology jump into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a superconductor in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good times and bad times, in the war and in peace, in recession, in depression.
It's the very quick computer results used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's graffiti in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to Moore's Law Horse, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of Autodesk call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics , 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines and food, digital medicine, nanotechnology and A.I . .
I mean, how many saw the victory in Watson of Watson, IBM?
It was epic.
I looked in newspapers the best headline there was.
And I loved this:``Watson versus human opponents . ''
Jeopardy is not an easy game.
He plays with the mathematics of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Niclonics University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we ask them to launch a company, or a product or service, that can potentially affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be absurd sound.
We can point out a couple of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating luxury life for every single person on the planet; it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that it's scarce and becoming plentiful.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon III in 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
He invited dinner the King king.
The Napoleon troops ate with silver covers, and the same Napoleon, with gold covers.
But the king of Miami, she ate with aluminum covers.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet; it's more than the gold and the dish.
That's why the room of the monument to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although the aluminum is 8.4 percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and silicon.
But then the electricity came and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was throwaway.
We project this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet bathed by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the 16 hours of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but accessible.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the gene's generation -- 8,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity would cost six cents the kilowatt-hours compared to the 15 cents of the national media.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have water abundance.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth in 1990, after the Saturn country?
I took a famous picture . What was it called?
\" A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a water planet.
We live in a planet covered by 70 percent water.
Yes , 97 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight by 0.5 percent of the water on the planet, but here's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 years, but right now.
nanotechnology, the nanotechnology.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the outbreak -- I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to do it -- his technology called Shina, you know, it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any seawater, water water, a latrine for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just agreed that to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have a full confidence that it's going to be, Coca-Cola will implement it in 26 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation for this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the perception of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of information abundance and communications that no one could ever have predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of dollars -- GPS video, video HIV, images, book libraries and music, medical diagnostic technology now are deforested and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing is when the health enforcement applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Palaman Foundation, something called the X Prize Campaign Prize , 10 million dollars.
We're challenging teams in the world so that they combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has A.I, they can take it, you can extract blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where mortality charge is 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent health workers.
When this device sequence is a RNA virus or DNA virus that doesn't recognize, call the health care and, first, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increases.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to stop the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never ever heard of global conversation.
What do these people want?
What do you want? What do you want?
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And they're going to make it healthier because of the tradition, from a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, educated and productive healthy?
How about a few voices never before?
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What will these three billion?
What if it's contributions that we can't predict?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things -- things that previously could do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Pollinant.
I came up at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein will fold.
The folds determine structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a supercomputer problem.
They've played with this university teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people were killed and they started playing it.
And it's shown that today's recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the brain.
We have the capital of the telescope.
And we have three billion new minds that are going to join us to work in the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
It's the correction of the game.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1834.
You may believe that I would chase penguins, but it didn't.
He actually picked fish.
And I described one of them like very common.
It was the grouper.
I found it very much until the 1880s.
Now the fish is in the Red List of the IUCN.
But we've heard this story many times, on Galapagos and other places, so that's not special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're pristine.
The brochures still say they're still intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate.
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't from there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The line was surrounded by palm, and, as you can see, of some mangroves.
And there were about 20 centimeters, the black beard tilapia.
And the fishing of this thylacine was very plentiful, and it went through a good moment, so it was earning more than the middle in Ghana.
When I was there , 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined half.
They mature the five centimeters.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the introduction of land fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, well, it started in the 1960s did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen, to impose industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, was called The Museum 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in South Central China, and especially in the Java Sea.
What we captured was something inevitable.
Now we captured, now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponges, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs on some remains, remains that are fish of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover, and then it was thrown.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study, and then you start commercial fishing.
The background is a solid fund of soft coral, in this case, to be a radio.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them . They took them because they were dead.
We once captured a living.
I was still not drowning.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of rest is what the fishermen are collecting every time they go to an area where they have never fished.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of departure, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this something like this.
On the axis, we have good things: biodiversity, lots of holes, the verb of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time . It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images that are received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal as normal and extracting it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
They didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the difference of changes.
And at the end of keeping some miserable remains.
And that, largely, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer, or not what they were.
But one should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very abundant, before you get extinct, it's little often.
You don't lose plentiful animals.
You lose slightly frequent animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become little often because we fish them.
Over time, you have a few fish, but we think that's the stop point.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, would question that it was very different.
And you'll do it because the evidence in a previous way is not the way they will expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some people present, sort of captain such as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually you don't use the fisheries of fishing, because it's not scientific.
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in built societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Hence the huge role that can be made a marine marine area.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really recreate the past.
We collected the past that people can't conceive because the game's point has run and it's very low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that they provide, which allows them to erase their stop point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can probably fill the vacuum . simulation.
This is a simulation of the Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay , 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that math and transitions are like``Avatar . ''
And if you think about``Avatar ,"if you think why people were moving with the movie without talking about the story of Pocaro, why would you go with the images?
Because it evolves something that, in a certain sense, has lost.
So my recommendation, the only one to give, is to Cameron, to do``Avatar II"underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi.
It's true.
And so today we'll see why videos are getting viral and what important things have.
We all want to be stars: celebrities, singers, comedians -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper note in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a sanctity.
It's over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And, of those, only a small percentage becomes viral, it gets innovation of visitors and gains cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators, engaging communities and surprise factors.
Okay, let's start.
Beau Tasmanian: Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
Ooh, wow.
KA: Last year, Beth Levin published this video filmed outside her home at the Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the population rise of the past summer.
Beau is not supposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Young Mountain kissing.
I had already published many videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kims.
Jimmy Kimba published this tweet that collapses the video to popularity.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmel presents us new and interesting things and they are a wider audience.
Rebecca Black: It's Friday, Friday . You have to start Friday . Everybody wants to get the weekend, the weekend . Friday, Friday, starting Friday . KA: You won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, hope.
\" Friday"from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like``arc rainbow double ,"this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you wonder about those other peaks, they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday?
Well, Tom Toyo, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Mister Science Theater, was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends of trends embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 episodes in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the U.S. century entertainment, this community participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon by spreading or doing something new with that.
\" No Catherine"is a repetitive animation with a chord music.
That's, that's it.
This year, it was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet phone community.
There were remembers.
Somebody made a version of the old.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community of remix that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all make part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted``Architecture Dougles double"or``No Cat Cat"?
What did you have written that you could have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video come up by minute, only that really unique and unexpected can be rid of the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that he had to do this great video of a guy who protests against the cycles in New York, admit that I don't care too much.
Casey Nashman: I was forced by not circular by the bicycle, but often there are obstacles that prevent you right away by the bicycle.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and your humor, Casey Nigeria made five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
Beau Valley: What does this mean?
Ooh.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines popularity.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Bieber, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the current media, but to define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still running.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique unit of unity and freedom of his country.
Imagine as the communist comes into Saturn, facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
Words, for so much friends, are now drinking it.
It was reported in silence.
He died by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not letting that have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be crushed, but we did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when you're going to be silent to the sea.
My mother, Mau, had only 18 years when her father died, and a concentrated marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a task, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four-year-old age that defies fiction, a boat was sliding into the sea disguised of fishing ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the pirate, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a jar with poison.
If they caught us, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the propensity of the engine, and the horizon vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, ending the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, let's look at Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in Fortunation, a working suburb whose population is composed of immigrants.
Unlike middle-class suburbs, whose existence I knew, in Forty, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English contributed to the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get an IT degree.
We were poor.
All the dollars were assigned, and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take away, which was generally new clothes; it was always a second.
Two pairs of media for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the ankles, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird and painful singers on the``rational eyes"and some graffiti,``Asian, go home . ''
At home, where?
Something in me is hardened.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said,``I'm going to overcome them . ''
My mother, my sister and I slept on the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we were told about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered peacekeepers, all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to wake up.
She opened a computer shop, then studied to be a status and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and inflational, and traditionally transplanted kids between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and sponsors.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, implicit with what I demand from myself.
On the other hand, I was buried in prioritized lives, tragic promoted by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many received aid over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I was elected the young Australian year.
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So I read For Apple's anonymous resident, it was now such a resource and social activist, invited to speak in sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the routines and the comfort of life in an indigenous suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling about the day of each one and burning asleep, three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got on the boat.
The``no"had been an option.
\" Do it ,"he said,``And you're not what you are . ''
So I talked about juvenile and education and distance to the marginalized and the protections.
And the more frankly I talked, the more I was able to speak.
I met people from all walks in life, many of them doing what they loved, living in the border of the possible.
And although I finished my bachelor, I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly, new thing in the scene -- and not only is it okay, but it's something that you will be grateful, maybe a ship of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean to collapse the horizons, it can easily mean accepting your province.
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is depressed, but not the way we fear.
Possibilities that hadn't been allowed to be extremely encouraged.
There was an energy there, an implicit optimism, a rare mixture of humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
I joined a little group of people who the motto``can't be done"was an irresistible challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a penny.
At the end of every day, I made a giant soup of soup that we all shared.
We worked until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After one journey.
My hunch again.
Three months later, I had moved, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where Congress was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person that mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At 17, it became a committee of a Mandarin whose mother hit her.
With no support of his husband, he caused a revelation to sue it and take the cause himself, and much more revealed when he won.
You can't do it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel in Sydney when she died, at 1,000 miles in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower lamp and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to wake up.
My mother called minutes later.
And days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Fortunation, and we sat around his attack.
We tell him stories, and we made sure we were still with her.
At night a monk came up and told us he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monk,``Why is your hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold? ''
\" Because you have taken your hand from the morning, he said.
\" You haven't solved it . ''
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because we were and how life formed us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have frustrated.
The defeat had easily touched.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want that to do that?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a test in their lives, bringing brave in each wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it safe, I would do it.
Tribe Neil, and also the mother of that is today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star sky, with the Sufi Muslim Muslim Ali.
We were conversation of how nothing has changed since the old Indian epidemic``The Mahabharata . ''
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car, and we cut up the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when Arab, the great Indian warrior prince, he had thirst, he took a bow, and with a string on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with drill and machines.
The conclusion we had was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that really sad me.
And every time I felt a little bit more toxic.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't bring my friends to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver.
And this technological piece of age was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and narcosis in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent that we are.
They provide our inspiration.
That's why I launched, I was brought into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
It illustrates books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers in the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we.
I'll bring the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
narrative becomes increasingly multi-polar.
But what does that do?
I'm about to launch Khaled, an iPad approach for iPad.
He says,``Put your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says,``This box belongs to --"I wrote my name.
And so I become a book character.
In several moments, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live, because of GPS -- that comes straight to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that we embrace from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they illuminate your way in what's left from the book.
Another idea I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy knows in a ball.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a ball that I drag into this magical device, within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there have always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, police and guide during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it also reveals.
Now I'm going to go into.
Another really important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the sponsors.
We've all heard of the fairies and the colonies, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts, they would take them up?
These poor people have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child story.
In a story that deals current issues like environmental crisis.
And, by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked down to their PCs, they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections -- of sticks, stones, shooting and shells.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual ritual, you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So it's created a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a fox and says,``Oh, I saw a fox . ''
A child in India says,``I saw a monkey today . ''
And this kind of social network is created around a collection of digital photographs that have been taken.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we've been trying to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video, and through the augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inside plants of the house.
In a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to take them out so you can read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic, and technology is approaching each other.
We take the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many health projects fail.
And I think the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at Radio University was to drive a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she reached a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and known,``What happens? ''
\" How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems that everybody, or maybe not all, but most of the health projects fail, because we stop listening.
This is my single Wikipedia scan . It's very simple.
It has a fire.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 kilograms.
But it's so simple, every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Health.
And my doctor's doctor has access to him too . So, he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs cardiac assistance or some urgency of that style, but to see it back.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my scanner Wi-Fi, and before I go up to my car, people start talking to me,``Listen, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week I'll be available.
This little slum connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they will recover control and to be captains of their own boat, but they can also help us care for health care because of the challenges that we face, like the cost of the costs of medicine attention, the doubling of demand and other issues.
I'll make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we did was to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM players are.
Also where all the gas is.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest DNA to help this patient?
We ask, but nobody knew.
Nobody knew where to get the DNA saving lives right now.
What we did was we did crowdsourcing in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to: If you look at a DNA, please see where, and when it's open, because sometimes open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DVDs were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for tears, augmented reality, to find these DNA.
And every time you're in the city of Marshall and someone collapse, you can use their iPhone, and the next weeks you're going to use their Microsoft cell phone to find the nearest DNA, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like DNA, which is the name of the product, but also as AIDS.
And we would want to start at the world level.
We're having all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the credit of the DNA around the world.
Every time you're in vacation and someone collapsed, it can be a relatives or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DVDs.
They could be a message service or a telephone service, for example, to see if the DNA that's shown is still in place.
Please help us in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it the photograph?
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15.
It was mixed with my previous passion, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera, the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the lung.
For me, the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
That's why I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the lung.
photos like this: a building in a very transmitted road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that, it keeps a level of realism.
Or photos like these -- dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of realism.
And when I say realistic, I say photographs.
Because, of course, it's not something that can capture, but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
Photographs where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's got more to do with capturing an idea that's going to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them real?
Are the details or the colors?
Do you get light?
What creates illusion?
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic, but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly imaginable objects, which we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional; as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photographs.
It really consists to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic, I think that's the ones that we don't even think about, the things that surround us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to consider it, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the combined photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images, they came up with these requirements; they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect union.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
I could think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated.
But this picture is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place than finding it, because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the puzzle parts.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yes, I even made the house red at the top of the island so that it seems more Sweden.
So to make a realistic result, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thought.
If you do a good job when you take pictures, the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start by showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please.
It's a diagram who took from a folder mine.
I'm not so interested in showing you the details, but the overall aspect.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of the extracellular microprocessors versus the power of local areas.
What's interesting about this is that this, like many other people we tend to see, is a straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step from here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
talking about technology with physical curves is something novel.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
I would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we plot technological curves on logarithmic scales?
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to draw, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if a graph, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a physical curve, would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a qualitative change.
If the technology of transportation would move as fast as the microprocessors, tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But I don't move to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a disruptive growth that every few years forward magnitude orders.
The question I want to plan is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this as fast as it goes.
One of two things happened.
Or it's going to become a typical curve.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
So we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and wonder, is what is that new way that you adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're immersed in it.
I remember that the future happened in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has shrunk, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because it's all going to be so different that it extrapolate what we're doing today.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition we experience.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computing.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The time scale I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we took about two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that float around it.
If we look at the way we organize those chemicals, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA . I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, I had floating some oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet contain a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate the exterior material, and so the blobs grew up.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil droplet.
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they divide, they took an unequal distribution of the chemicals that they contain.
That's why every droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow differ to be better at the time of incorporating chemicals, grow more, they're getting more chemicals and they divide more.
They usually lived longer, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we didn't understand these blobs, they learned how to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to replicate.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to be stable, since they evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 megawatts of white dust that I try to hide to the security people.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragments, and I amplified 10 at 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the present, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was an algebra, it would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and that was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information, forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and they were shot to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that would form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they made a synergy.
And so they survived or fail together, so if a community was very successful, all the individuals of that community were represented more and they were favorite by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were so close that they actually joined and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multicultural community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart, or the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started to abstract information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in community.
It's neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to register, understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that point as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not to the evolutionary time period.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system builds those information structures enormously, the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur to an individual.
It could happen in the necessary time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
So if we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in the head.
I'm sitting here, and I'm sitting here, and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and confusing, in their heads that I had a certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to make abstractions.
We're now going through periods similar to multicellular organisms; we abstract our record methods, presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The telephone, the computer, the video tape, the CRISPR, etc . is the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary example of the T in which it produced some evolution with the College program, before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story I told you took a billion years every one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next, language etc., took less than a million years.
And the next ones, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is feedback; I guess automatic is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process feeds.
But I made my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I work to design them would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible to me in conventional ways.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that connection machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of Titanic Machines, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that before you can't, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes I employ methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say,``Please computer, can you run a hundred million sequences of random instructions?
Can you run these sequences of random instructions, run all those programs, and take those that are closest to what we want to do? ''
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more closely approaching numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, could be able to look at two numbers in the right order.
And I said,``computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that I better did the task?
We manage those and eliminate the rest.
And now we reproduce the ones that are best ordered.
And we're going to play it back to a process of analog resonance to sex . ''
Let's take two programs, that they train children, which are subsiditions, and kids inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say,``Please repeat the process . ''
It's collecting again.
So it involves some mutations.
And it tries again and it tries again and repeated with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that ordered numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark, strange programs.
But they make the committee.
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal, because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it.
Once I was in a 747 with Mark Minsky, and I got a card and he says,``Look at this.
He says,``This plane has hundreds of thousands of habitats working together to offer a safe flight .' Doesn't make you feel quiet? ''
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the entire choices there.
In that sense, it goes ahead of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can run these programs much faster.
That is, it feeds.
The thing is getting faster and faster, and so I think it seems so confusing.
Because all these technologies are feedback.
We're expanding.
And we're at an analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they became multicellular.
We are the amoeba, and we can't understand what a hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever it comes.
But now it comes the lunch, and I think I'll stop here before I'm eliminated.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been running enough time to allow me to be part of my fake bias in that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the World Series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about to get out``breaking the rules"-- talk about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'll focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called a battery average.
And we talked about 300, of a bat that batteries 300.
That means that the bat bat effectively means, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game's field without being trapped, and anyone who tries to launch it to the first base, doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be saved.
Three 10 attempts.
You know how you call a 300 bat in the Great League?
Well, really good, perhaps the team of stars.
You know how you call a 400 baseball bat?
By the way, that's somebody from 10 hits, accelerated four.
legendary -- like the legendary Ted Williams, the last Lough League player, to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's transform this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you've got apps and they're derived to a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in applications.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a dear self has two orbital arteries, and your family physician gives it to a cardiologist whose record record is 200.
But you know something?
She's really improving this year.
And their assets have been 255.
This is not working.
But I'm wondering.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic, or a nurse, or a census hurdle?
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the entire medicine knows the actions of a good surgeon, a doctor or a doctor.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and I include, with the mandate of being perfect.
That's never, ever, make a mistake and try to figure out how to do well.
That was the message I absorbed when I was in medicine school.
I was a computer obsessed student.
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood exam.
That's what.
I studied in my little mess, in the nurses of the General Hospital Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my kind of anatomy, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every art coming out of the front, the ultimate differential diagnosis and not usual.
And I even knew the difference of how to classify kidney pipes.
And meanwhile, more and more and more knowledge.
And I was very good . I graduated with honor.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if you memorized everything, then I would know everything, or most possible, close to the whole, because that's how I'm immune from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Dr. Drums.
I was resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the Dr. Drums to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the cardiology service.
And when you emergency a cardiologist, I got to join that patient.
And I'll report the chief of residents.
When I saw the Lord Drone, I was running.
I heard a solar sound.
And when the crowd, I heard a boundary sound on both sides, which I was telling me a frozen heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pushing the blood forward, blood goes to lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it, and I started working on the treatment that I would give.
He gave it adoption and medicine to relieve pressure in his heart.
He gave them distances, water pills, so he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when he ate the first mistake; he sent her home.
Actually, I took two more mistakes.
He sent her to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and I'm going to take it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I could have been able to give it complicated information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I probably didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior who said,``Goldman, it's not a good idea . Don't do it . ''
In fact, I was so insecure I asked the nurse to take care of the Dr. Drums,``Do you think it's okay if you go home? ''
And the nurse thought, and then he said,``Yes, I think it's okay . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high, and the ambulance along with the doctors took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, had a bad presentation in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I packed to leave the hospital and walk into the parking parking room where my car was to go home . At that time I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency emergency service.
And there's another nurse there, not the one I was going to take care of the Lady before, but another . He told me three words, those three words that most emergency physicians fear.
Other specialists fear too, but there's a particular part of it, and that is that we see the patient's patients.
The three words are: Do you remember?
\" Do you remember the patient who sent his house? ''
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
\" Well, she came back ,"with the same tone tone.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the end of an hour of having come home, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called 911; the doctors brought it to emergencies with an artificial pressure of 50 millimeters of Hait, which means a severe shock.
I would barely breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff came up all their resources.
They gave it medication to climb the blood pressure.
And they put an artificial breath.
I was shocked and shaking to the spinal cord.
I had a mix of feelings, because after the stabilize was in intensive therapy, and expected against every hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days, it was evident that I would never wake up.
He had an irreversible brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they got rid of what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let him go . Mrs. Drone, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks, I was punished by it and experiment for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture and felt just, isolated, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The evil shame I'm talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my boss; he was an charm.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I support things and make sure that they don't demand me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did he send her home?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a mistake so dumb?
Why did I choose medicine?
gradually that feeling was spreading.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, he opened the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I posed the efforts to be perfect to do not make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And that was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, it was help in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy.
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little colorful.
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he turned to the door, he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard change, my boss asked me to talk to me carefully in his office.
And he made the three words: Do you remember?
Do you remember the patient that he saw by a pain in the throat?
Because he came back and he didn't have a skeletal phrase.
It had a potentially deadly condition called apples.
You can look at Google . It's an infection, not the throat, but from the upper air, and that can cause the closing of those pathways.
He, fortunately, didn't fail.
It's managed by antibiotics, and it's reversed at a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and reproduction, then encouraged me and went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same tube of urgency, not an app diagnosed.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it's got 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a stranger.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They order a kidneys X-ray, but it was normal . A colleague that was recording the patient perceived a sense on the bottom right quadrant and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to rehydration and asked my colleague to review it.
You check it up, and he noticed a certain sensitivity on the lower right corner, called the surgeon.
They were both operated, and they recovered well.
But every case I got stuck, I was broken.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a performance.
The most significant have been for the last five years.
Just, embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: if I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do you teach them that they don't make the same mistakes?
If I go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party, you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but they won't listen to somebody to talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a translator in my hospital adopted the wrong leg, believe me that I would have difficulty in looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two positions: the ones that make mistakes and the ones that can't sleep and the ones that you do -- the ones who have the results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we stop from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of medicine and medical journalism, I've done a personal medical study and medical mistakes to learn the possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Toronto to my program:``White Court, Black Art ,".
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 prescribed drugs in the hospital are wrong, or double-controlled is not right . In a system where intergalactic infections are increasingly, and more numerous, causing chaos and death.
In this country , 24,000 Canadian Canadian mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about fancy subsidies, because we're not destroying the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three years, and we don't update.
The privacy of sleep invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest in the chest, and it comes crazy with the eyes, and with random eyes, and all of a sudden, my story is disappointed.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things like this.
And my patients are not cars . They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all of the professional professionals to mistake, well, no one.
And with respect, people don't want to talk about their biggest cases?
In my program,``White art, black art ,"it's a custom to say,``This is my worst mistake ."I would say to everybody from the ambulance to the heart of heart surgery,``This is my worst mistake ,"blah, blah, blah --``What are your mistakes?"And I would run the microphone to
And their students would stop, they would go back, lower their head and swallow out and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to say,``Look, don't make the same mistake . ''
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a redefine medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefine doctor is human, you know, it accepts it, and it doesn't get proud of its mistakes, but it's effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
I share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out the mistakes of other people not in the intention of catching them, but in a loving, loving way for everybody to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are driving the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes every time.
My name is Brian Gollah.
I'm a redefine doctor.
I'm human, I make mistakes.
And I'm very sorry, but I'm happy to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I remember.
Do you know how many decisions take a day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I did a survey to more than 2,000 people, and the average amount of choice that says to choose an average American, is about 70 a day.
Not much, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are played by these executives and the time they used to make related decisions with those tasks.
They found that, in average, they took 130 jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of minds.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
You know how many belong to the nine-year-old category, and how many of an hour?
How does it qualify the way that we manage those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems today: choice to the options of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm a blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please, you give a palm.
And now my first question of the day: Are you ready to talk about the problem of choice overload?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, this very, very high level supermarket, at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called drones.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar, more than 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water, and this was when we took water from the faucet.
I loved going to that store, but I was wondering, why did I never buy anything?
This is the source of olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the box that came from a military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager, and I asked him,``Does this strategy work well to offer all these choices? ''
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the seeds.
hallway.
They had 420 different classes.
We installed a post to figure out, right at the entrance of the store.
We put out there from six flavors, or 24 different flavors, and we looked at two things: First, what do people were willing to stop to try and try to try and test the membrane?
More people stopped when 24 -- 60 percent, that when there was only six , 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a marketing lake.
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those of you who stopped when there was 24, only three percent came to buy memorial.
Of those who stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought memorial.
If we did the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy if they found six, that if they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy a member of us probably gets us, at least it's good to conserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of choice overload affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't convince us.
Now the issue of the day: the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with guru Hubble, Embassy Kamenian and Wei Jane, where we looked at the savings decisions for the retirement of a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds available in savings for retirement, the 404 program, discussed people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a correlation.
We had 65,000 plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of funds offered, there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as it was like.
And in the plans that they offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 60 percentile.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So, for those of you who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, more people were involved to avoid the actions or the investment funds.
As soon as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will recommend to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they make the decision, and they apply it even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick up less satisfying things, even though they objectively get better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant array of mass, mustard, vinegar and memorable, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare, contract and choose from that impressive exhibition.
Today I want to propose four simple techniques that we've tried, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first one is, Cut.
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always bother when I say,``Cut . ''
They worry about losing space in the anatomy.
But actually what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to cut up, you're going to get rid of, you get strange redundant options, there will be an increase in the sales, you'll go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When I practiced & Gamble, I spent 26 different types of Head & Shakes to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Corporation, it removes the products for cat waste products that they less sold, the odds were increased in 87 percent, by two causes: greater sales and lower cost.
You know that today's supermarkets, in average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the world's largest stores in the world today is villages and offers only 140 products -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how choices are the plant of David Lawrence, the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are automatically embedded to a insurance fund.
Those who really want to choose, they're offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say,``I don't know how to cut.
They're all important options . ''
The first thing I do is to ask employees,``Tell me the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't differentiate, they cannot make your customers . ''
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Gary.
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience, a few vaccines with everything paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the Facebook supply.
( few applause) Okay . Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
Aren't they?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really have to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second one . But I can go ahead and say you thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of choice overload, which is Congress.
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that consequences must feel very vivid, very concrete.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use effective?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shakespeare Benjamin and Alexander President, on an NGO personnel, who worked at Indian -- these people were in a meeting where they were being applied to a 404 plan.
At that meeting, that we were exactly as used, we made a little addition.
What we added was that we went to the staff to think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
And with this puzzle, there was an increase in the 20th percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts, four percent.
The third technique is Class.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the Germany supermarkets, it's along the northeast corridor, the magazines exhibition can contain from 3.3 different types to 646.
But, you know?
Because classification tells me how to differentiate.
These are two jewelry exhibition.
One is called``Jack"and the other,``Syndispert . ''
If you think the one on the left is Swin, and the one on the right is Jack, you give a palm.
( Little applause) Okay, there are some.
If you think the one on the left is jazz, and the one on the right is Swins, you give a palm.
Okay, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is jazz, and the one on the right is Swins . But, you know something?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something that you choose, not when it's defined.
It's often seen this problem with those huge funds of funds.
I suspect who are being informed?
My fourth category: Congressing complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very complicated decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German carbon manufacturer that allows them to personalized.
You have to take 60 decisions, to assemble the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that every one.
Color outside of the car . I have 56 possibilities.
engine, change box, four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options , 56 colors, to a few, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at?
How involved you are.
If you're always active, the defect button in every decision, this indicates you're overwhelmed, and we're losing them.
We found that the ones that go from many choices to a few, they're using the button for default over and over again, and another.
We lose them.
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose.
Although the choosing box of change, it doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner decoration, in all ways we're prepared to choose.
We make a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
Just to summarize.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choices: Coast, eliminate strange alternatives -- concrete, make it real; classify, we can handle more categories with less options -- to monitor complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage alternatives, or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for the people who serve.
It's that I think the key to get the best of an election is being careful by choosing.
And the more careful we are in our choices we can be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '80s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter, you had to register it to the government.
I had to register a text sheet of an example of the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If you found a writer with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we didn't think that someone could do this, how much this will limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer, and you print a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots in every page that follow a pattern that makes them themselves and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to fuss a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can get the attacks on their attacks.
There are three main groups.
So, there are commandments.
Like Mr. Dimitri University of Kiev's city, in Ukraine.
The cybercriminals' cell is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a lot of money.
There are really many cases of millions online, multinational, who won money with their attacks.
This is Valley Tesla, from Turkey, Estonia.
This is Alfred Golden.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bruce Sunday.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tari Alexander etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means through banking triangles to steal money from our account when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this lady, Sam Jain, and this account had 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jain.
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong in worse.
In the future, most of the crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have declined in the last 12 months taking a paper on the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: the criminals who do it for money, the hackers like Anonymous who do it to protect, and the latest group are the national states the governments that attack.
And then we see cases like Dicking.
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
Dictionary is an authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
He declared the last fall because of a salad.
They were surrounded by the security of the site and they perpetrated a cyberattacks.
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of the death of people because of a Dictiven attack.
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
Dictionary is a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What do the certificates serve?
Well, you need if you have a website with attentions, SMS encrypted services, services like Gmail.
Except you're going to be able to get a foreign certified authority.
And they're going to be able to emit application.
And in the case of Dictory, it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, protesters took the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the dawn of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this titled``FDA"called``FDA . ''
And within that folder, there were notes of a firm company in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool by 200,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company's headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, he found the Schritz Troque -- a triangle used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervene.
But today it goes beyond.
connection to the Internet.
You can even use tools like the Scottish Troo to infect our computer with a triangle to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions, to get our data.
When we think about things like this obvious answer should be``Well, it looks bad, but I really don't affect it because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry about me?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy doesn't argue.
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
Now, if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we are today is forever.
Are we blindly confident in any future government, in an administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live . I live in Kenya, in the South National Park Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi doesn't have close to the South part of the south, which means wild animals like the zebras migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like lions, followed them, and this is what they do.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning, and we found it dead, because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the masses, we think we come from heaven with our animals and all the land to pass them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
The dying are warriors that protect our community and livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for his father's livestock, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually this doesn't serve, because even helped lions to see the stable stable.
I don't give me . I continue.
One second idea was to use a spark.
I tried to deceive lions to think that it was near the stable.
But the lions are very smart . They came from the first day and they saw the spark, and they went, but the second day, they came back and said,``This thing doesn't move, it's always here . So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the shelf with an torch, and that day the lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I would try and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken flashlight.
Everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery, and the battery supply electricity into the little Indian box.
And the Indian box makes light light.
As you can see, the bulbs go out, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights go down and deceive lions to think that I'm walking around the stable, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them . You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by the whole Kenya, to scare other predators as hyenas, leopard, and it's also using the elephants of farms.
So thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brooklyn International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to put them.
So, a year ago, I was just a kid in the sands of the savanna to track my father's cows, and I used to see airplanes flying, and he told me that it would someday be within one.
And today I am here.
I got the opportunity to come in a plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilots when it grows.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad's cows and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
The sun . What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship . Richard Turing: Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
RM: My next invention is -- I want to make an electrical fence . CA: An electrical fence?
RM: I know that you've already invented electrical fences, but I want to do the mine.
CA: You've tried it once, right? And you -- LT: I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a wire . CA: At the foot of the canyon . Richard Turing, you're a big thing.
We're going to encourage every step that you did, friend mine.
Thank you very much . RD: Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called``I don't envy anything . ''
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim Il-Sung history, but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my sister's colleague.
He said,``When you read this, the five family members will stop being in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're restored together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die . ''
I was very alternative.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A living woman was dead in the street, holding a child scared in his arms looking at the face of her mother without able to do anything.
No one helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A massive base bomb to North Korea in the middle of the '90s.
At the end, more than a million Koreans died during famine and only few survived, eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also made more and more frequent energy cuts, all around me, was completely in the night except for the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Amazon River, which is a limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very honest at certain points, allowing Koreans to cross secretly.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life as a Norwegian refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because ordinary refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be represented to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare came true, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was interested in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being North, so they tested my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and sport.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered questions.
At the end of the interrogation, an officer told another one,``This was a fake report . She's not North . ''
And they let me go . It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China look for asylum in foreign embassy.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and the sports.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, North Atlantic are captured in China and sports in North Korea, where they're tortured, income or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of its world can be taken in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to get to the South Korea.
I started a new life again.
In South Korea, it was a much greater challenge than I expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all Koreans, but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of division.
They even went through a crisis of identity.
Am I surfing or North?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could call my pride.
Even though I'm going to adapt to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I did a plan, I started studying for the university exam.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were interested in some money that sent my family, and, as a punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a local location outside.
They had to flee immediately.
I began to plan how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China, and I walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, over 3,000 miles across China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The bus journey took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by an official of Chinese police.
He asked the identification of everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family, I couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I immediately stood up, and I told him that they were super-energy people who were accompanying.
I looked at me suspicious, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the Law border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lagos.
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border of the border.
And after you pay for crowds and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the Ladies capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was sentenced in prison prison from the South Korean embassy.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or crowds.
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man asking me,``What's the problem? ''
I was so surprised that a stranger would care about it.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt, the man went to the ATM, and I gave the rest of the money for my family and for another two Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I thank you with all my heart, and I asked him,``Why do you help me? ''
\" I'm not helping you ,"he said.
\" I'm helping the North people . ''
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The yellow unknown symbolizes a new hope for me and for the North town when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the hope rays that the North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go up to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, work practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very lucky, I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you give Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is Central Central: grocery stores, fast food, bags.
So the planners in the city got together and thought, we're going to change the South Central name to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this would actually be wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles, South stores, fast food, balloon land.
Just like 26 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Central South, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get more people killed the food in the car.
People are dying of curable diseases in the South Central South Angeles.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I'm glad to see that this happens.
And I wonder, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home, you see the damaging effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I see chairs of bought wheels, and sold as cars used.
I see closely lung crime centers like Starbucks.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I've also been tired of driving 45 minutes away, and I go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land farm we call a gardening.
It's 45 feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said,``Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it . ''
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Group, we got together, and we started planting our food forest, fruit trees, you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group paid by addressed by gardens of all the processes, from all the city and completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then somebody complained.
And the city got up on me, and in summary, they gave me a quote saying I had to remove my garden, the cyclist became a juvenile order.
And I was like,``We are, right?
A judicial order to planting food on a piece of land that nobody cares?"So it was like,``Well, let me go . ''
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Leopardo, and spoke to the computer and one of the members of Green Greens, who put a petition in Chandol, with 900 signatures, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My computer even called to say that they went back and adore what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more balloons.
It's 68 miles of balloon land.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 72 million assembly plants.
Why don't you look good about this?
We grow a plant to give a thousand , 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of holes will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my anthem, when I tell people, they grow your own food.
So growing your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central South.
I grew up there.
I was referring to being part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me by others, and I will make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my graffiti, I grow my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, which is embraced walls, I'm wearing soils, gardening.
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my entire canvas of that canvas.
You're surprised to see what the land can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witness how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They will be surprised to see how the kids affect.
gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do, especially in an urban.
Also, you get strawberries.
I remember an occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, they were like 1934 in the night, and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very busy.
I, well, man, felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to hunger, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me,``End, no temes that people will steal your food? ''
And I say,``Oh, no, I'm not afraid you're going to steal it . ''
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at once, I want you to take your health . ''
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a record shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous, and they shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green Group has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, as 50 people who come, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow color, kids will eat color.
If you grow tomatoes, you'll eat tomatoes . But if none of this is taught, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, they eat blindly what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're trapped in, I see color kids that are in this path designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With the gardening, I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are commissioned from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next Gergan Washington Carter is produced.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole garden block, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy cafes.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to support it.
What I'm talking about is to get people to work, to get kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, opening farmers of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become engaged, self-assembly, genetic gardens.
We have to change the script of what's a survey.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a management.
That the projections take their stick right?
That's his gun gun.
In addition, if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit -- to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your stick so that we can plant something.
Peace . Thank you.
Thank you.
( hammer sound) You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt, and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, in which it takes a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you're going out.
And especially if you're riding in your bicycle, and these cars happen, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make porous asphalt roads.
The porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores, and the water can go through it, so all the rain water flow down to the sides and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and you won't jump water up anymore.
The noise also disappears in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappears, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can get rid.
What is it going to take? See that in this road, the stones on the surface are coming out.
First of a stone, then several more and more and more, and then -- you know, it's not going to do that . But you can harm your windshield, and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bump with that.
Oh . It's ready.
Bach, of course, can become a problem, but we have a solution.
And here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a porous asphalt, as I said, so it only has a little amount of warning between the stones.
Because of the performance, the ultraviolet light, the oxygen, this addition, the glue, the glue between the rivers, will choose, and if you're shrinking, you'll make microbes and you're separated from the added.
So, if you drive through the road, you'll pull you up -- as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about self-assembly materials.
If we can make this material switch, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool, of that to clean series, and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the beta.
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an index machine.
The industry can heat, especially the steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the beta, the beta flow by these microbes, and the stones will look back on the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big income machine here on stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought,``Well, that's really interesting . We have to try it . ''
So they gave us a piece of road , 400 meters from the Arthur Arthur, where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there . You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm . That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of charges on them, we repair them, then with our industry machine, and we repair them, and we did it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the energy energy to actually increase the life of the road surface, they can even double the life of the surface . It will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity of whether this also worked.
We still have the show here . It's pretty hot.
And actually, you have to cool first before you can show you how the repair acts.
But I'm going to do an attempt.
Let's see . Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woke up a morning with the sound of the judge in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally depressed it.
\" The Taliban left!"I screamed my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
\" Now you can go to a real school ,"he said.
I'll never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came up with Afghanistan and made the girls illegal to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a kid to escort my older sister, I could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could suspect where we were going.
We had to hide the books in the market to seem like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us agreed in a little room.
It was nice in the winter, extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban suspected.
We always wondered what they knew from us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we lived?
We were attached, but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total I.Q . province of Afghanistan . I insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father repeated it.
But my mother education became masters.
This is her.
It will stop two years ago, just to convert our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not education.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember that there were times that I was very frustrated in our life, and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said,``Give me, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money . They can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So do you still want not to continue? ''
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age's women have more than the black, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate at Mr. College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was exiled from her home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate.
He didn't only get rid of my university title, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I've been driving it by the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 1970, a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded NSA, the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, advocate for them, despite and still in front of a daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed . It's not his real name, and I can't show you her face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
And less than a month ago, he and her daughter went from the road from UCLA to his village, and literally, they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road for minutes.
When you get home, you're the phone, a voice would warn you that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would try it back.
\" Let me go, if you want ,"he said,``But not harm the future of my daughter for his old and retreated ideas . ''
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeed, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, it's the first compelling interactions of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school, they count in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear these changes don't last much, after the United States troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, they encourage them, I see a future term and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of specific hope and possibilities, and every single day of UCLA reminds me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile,``daughter, resist Gaddafi . Fight against him.
But you never become a Gardener style . ''
They've spent almost two years since the free revolution is inspired by mass movements, both of the Tunisian revolution as well as the Egyptian.
A force with many other book citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of a floor and start a revolution against the computer regime of Gaddafi.
And we did it; it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the cutting-edge, demanding the fall of the regime, providing freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a value in the face of the diversity of Gaddafi.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and defeat the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy load, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and alternative seeds.
For four decades, the computer regime of Gaddafi destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of free society.
Conscious of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to, next to many other women, to rebuild the civil society, to bring an inclusive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation.
They were established about 200 organizations in Beijing during, and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Troother.
After a 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the Women Libya platform by Peace, a movement of women, leaders, very diverse orientation, to advocate by the socioeconomic autonomy of women and for our right participation right in the building of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the presidential period -- an environment that was increasingly polarized, which is moved from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 175 percent of the National Congress in the first 52 years.
However, gradually, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, they were disappearing; every day we found news news.
One day we woke up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi graves.
Another day I ended up with the murder of the American ambassador, and the car attack.
Another day we wake up with the news of the official officers of the military.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continual violations of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, polled more, and has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire them with our history of the success of``creative list"and the choices.
Now, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choose evil, make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
The creative list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated with selfish dominance policies and exclusion, both for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation creation of what the election needed, which only reinforce polarization and division.
Our nation needs qualitative representation of the female than need the numerical representation and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an agent of outrage and call day days.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse, not just honor, but also put mercy in place of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has an alchemy that's about the interface and the alternative between female perspectives and males.
That's the real creature.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a sociology form.
According to a``Salam"sign -- the peace -- that's the word of the merciful God, right, compassionate.
At the same time, the word``Rama ,"which is known in all the academic traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word``Ray"-- the signal -- symbolizes the feminine and material, which leaves all of humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the people have drunk.
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of nuclear compassion all of existence.
This is how we say,``My mercy on all things . ''
This is how we say,``My mercy is about my anger . ''
That you're all aware of the mercy of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing question, which has an equally disturbing answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody always do, why she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who sticks him?
I'm not a psychiatrist, not a social worker, no domestic violence expert.
I'm just a woman with a story I'll tell.
I was 22 years old . I had just been at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and a editor in the magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green American Mother Express, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my twin soul, he pointed to my head with a pistol, charged with a short balloon.
The man, which I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can remember . .
I'm here to tell the story of``crazy love ,"a psychological trap, display of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical substance of domestic violence.
I'm licensed in English from Harvard University, and I have an MBA in marketing of the White Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for the list of``Fortune 500 ,"among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Bureau and The Washington Post.
I take almost 20 years with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black laboratory, and I drove a Minister sling Odds.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all levels of yield and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the protesters are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate, interdependent and long-term relationships, or, in the other way, in families, the last place where we want or hope to find violence -- reason why domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that I would stay with a man who punched her, and I actually got a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, boyfriend and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night from January.
I was sitting on my side in New York subway, and he started to sign with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had also had a university of a University of League and worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that looked like a guy in the field.
He had big molecules like apples, and a wheat hair hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that I did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it about all at the beginning by putting in a pedestal.
And we started coming out and she loved everything from me, which was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, that put passion to help teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
I wrote in me, as a writer, as a woman, as nobody had ever done.
And that's why the bachelor in that prestigious school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to seduce and make the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave my dreams' work, but I thought I had to make a sacrifice for your partner, so I accepted, I left my job and icons and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a``crazy love ,"which was entering the head in a physical, financial and psychological trap carefully prepared.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it react.
And this is where they go into the scene.
As soon as we moved to New England, you know, that site where I was supposed to be so safe to feel three guns.
I had one in the car.
The next slope of the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns because of the trauma that I lived in small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message for me, and although I had never raised my hand, my life was already in a danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of concrete happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the truck.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's girlfriend suit and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we lived happily forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted me to.
And I was very, very correctly.
It has simply felt very overwhelmed by the wedding, and by the fact that you could form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never be hurt.
I spent twice as much as our honey moon.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach, and I lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I was running several times against the car window.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, he managed by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold.
And I kept watching one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One out of every three American women is a domestic violence victim or a moment in their life, and the Center of Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are battered , 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
I'm going to go back to my question: why did I stay?
The answer is simple.
He didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply tormented man, and it was the only person in the world who could help Congo to face their demons.
The other question that everybody else does is, why doesn't it just go down?
Why didn't I go? I could have been at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a malaria.
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the killings in the cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put end to the relationship, after you get away, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent harassment, even after the abuse has come back to marry, financial resources, and manipulation of the family's judicial system to land the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not with the man who was paying their mother.
And we still continue to ask why isn't it?
I was able to leave me, because of a last paper newspaper that I came up with my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed him.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody: police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to my friends, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stress victims as special headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question,``Why is it left? ''
So for some people, it's a way to say,``The guilt is yours for staying ,"as if the victims are going to try and get in love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published``Love Love ,"I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also escape, who learned an industrial lesson of what happened to them, and they did their lives and happy lives like employees, wives and mothers, completely free lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I became married with a tender and nice man, and we have those three children.
I have that black lab, and also that minority.
What I won't have ever more, ever, is a charged pistol pointing my head in hands of someone who says I want to.
At this point, they're just like,``Hi, that's fascinating!"or``Hi, what dumb it ,"but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, the ones that are listening to me right now, that they're being battered or that they were a little bit of a little bit of abuse.
The evil could be affecting his daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
And the abuse is just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the evil to the light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers, their friends and family.
They repair their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their scale and show the victims a safe salt.
Together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis that should be.
Thank you.
Hi . I called Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
It's accurate to be accurate for 10 years.
And I feel like, right now, there's an awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this . Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first clothing shift on a TED stage, so you're very lucky to witness it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when I showed up, don't have to tell it now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These tuna are very uncomfortable; less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to laugh from me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
appearance is powerful, but it's also superficial.
I've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer said to me to grab the back and get the hair out of the boy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one I made two days for work, there's very little we can do to transform our way, which, even though surface and unchanging, has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my job sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a sincere form.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say,``A Taliban discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to admire, we've also associated it at high and essential figure, to womanhood and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage, heritage that I've known to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now shows skeptical, and maybe there's some of the moves of the fashion that say -- wait . Oh, there's Naomi, Texas, Joan Sillis, Liu Wei.
First, happy to know so much about models . It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at New York City told each and every one of the models in the runway, and from 676 hired models, only 27, is to say, less than four, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Could it be model when it's greater?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja, cardiac surgeon surgeon, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist, no, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say,``I know my boss.
Because I'm not in the charge of anything, and you could be the reduction chief of the American magazine or the executive director of H & M, or the next Steven Mexico.
To say that more you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike cardiovascular surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've already finished your studies, and you have a curriculum and a few jobs, no matter what you say, if you said you wanted to be president of the United States, but your rsum of underwear for 10 years, the people would look strange.
The next question that people always do is if all of the photos are being challenged.
And yes, they're basically collecting all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that took me, and also the first time I used a bicycle, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal land, but it was a girl.
That's how it looks next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are from the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a pajamas party a few days before the photos for the French House.
Here I am with my football team and the magazine.
And this is me at the present.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creation of a group of professionals, hairs, machines, photographers and skeletons, and all their leaders and people of pride and ownership, and they make it to create this . That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always make me is: Do you get free things?
I have too many 20-year-old heel, and I never use, except the past couple, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store, and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a corner, and he jumped a red in red, and of course, they stood up, and it made a sense, agent to keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for me, not for what I am, and there are people who are paying a price for their aspects no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 14,000 teenagers who were stopped and recorded , 86 percent were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 17,000 black young black young people in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of me?
But how many times would you stop? And when?
By the research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent at 17.
So, the last question that people do is, what is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner, you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like it.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative, resourceful and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said before, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself,``With some more thin legs and hair, will be happier? ''
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the thinner legs, the brightest hair and the most close clothes, but probably the most physically insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the greatest benefits.
If there's something to get from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you about 15 most precious pictures, and I didn't go through them.
There were no artistic directors, no aliens, no opportunity to repeat photos, not even a minimal care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story begins when, finding me in New York City to give a condition, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday, that's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter came up, my wife said to me,``Why don't you take Saudi to New York in a daughter trip and you continue the ritual? ''
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
Nobody has been denied, and fortunately, no one has ever fled with the camera.
At the time, we weren't aware of how much our life would change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day, so a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week of October and making us reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, not only a physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reached new stories, and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly, he stopped in dry, and he pointed a red set of the wrist store that he took out of small visits.
And he described me what had been about five years of foot in that same place.
I said he remembered his heart to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York . .
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So, I want to share the idea of engaging actively in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one who runs the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and they don't doubt to get to somebody and ask it,``Do you get a picture? ''
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
Buttons are in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad press?
It's also associated with Disney laughter personalized like mental characters, dumb, stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press laughter, applause and claims, these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament . But I don't accept it.
I don't accept . You know why?
Because Parliament members don't keep the environment clean . parliament them don't help prevent disease spread.
They're hardly monogamous . They're far away from extinct . And, my favorite, the buses have better presence . There are two kinds of buses on this planet.
There are the New World bonds that are primarily found in the Americas, like the centers and the charges, and the Emily's banks, where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So, why are these things important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our natural garbage collectors.
They clean the carcasses to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria . They help absorb anthrax that not for them will spread and cause large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no casualties, the carcasses are about three to four times more time to decompose, and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
Business also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated to the old Egyptian culture.
Beat was the symbol of the projector and the maternity, and together with the cobra, they were similarly used by the top and the Netherlands.
In the Indian mythology, Jansky was the bus god, and he risked his life to save the Diameter Death Democratic Democratic.
In the Tibetan culture, they're done very important in open sky, in places like Tibet, there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to create them, so these bonds provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the bus?
We have eight bus species in Kenya, of which six are on extreme threatened extinction.
The reason is that they're being poisoned, and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife . The Palestinian communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the bonds are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bus are in the critical list of extinction danger, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will be extinct, and the reason is because they are prey of the cattle consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dickinson.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a position.
Since there are no casualties, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in the carcasses of carcasses, and when you have street dogs, you have a huge time bomb bomb for rage . The number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa : 33,000 farmers are going to be above the Turkana lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds . They cut them in half.
They are arms traditions.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible bus trade to serve the book and the feedback market.
So what's doing? Okay, we're investigating these birds . We're putting them transmission.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so focusing on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the bus, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services they provide.
How can they help?
When you go out of this room, you're informed about the bus, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the bus.
They're very elegant . Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, without energy spending in the skies.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
It's since 1971 to 1977 . Lucy, but I'm not yet . I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, on technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we built in Africa.
And I was disturbing.
I thought, at the age of 21, the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything we've been playing with it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book,``Olympics of the Bamball ,"was a project where we decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So, we arrived with Italian seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends to the Zambia River, and we teach the local local tomatoes and hallucinations, and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't fit . We were astonished that the local, in so fertile, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said,``Thank God we're here ."`` Just at time to save people from the famine of famine . ''
And of course, everything in Africa became beautiful.
We got these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size . In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the worms,``Look how easy agriculture is . ''
When the tomatoes were beautiful, mature and red, at night, about 200 hypothesis, we had a little bit out of the river, and they ate everything, and we said to the worms,``Oh my God, we hit them! ''
And the worms said,``Yes, so we don't have agriculture here ."`` Why didn't they say?"`` You never asked . ''
I thought we were only the Italians made mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans did, what the English did, what the French did, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the chimps.
You should see the waste -- you should see the waste that we gave to the people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read``Help Death"from Muslim Mosksawa, female economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donor countries, have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you the damage that that money has caused.
Just read their book.
Look from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are imperatives, colonialism missions, and we treat people just two ways: or the sponsors, or we're parasites.
The two words come from the Latin root``patent ,"which means``father . ''
However, it means two different things.
Patachi, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids .``I want you very much . ''
Patrick, I treat all of the different culture as if they were my servant.
That's why the white in Africa are called``gang ,"boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face .``Small is beautiful ,"I write by Souphon, who said above every economic development, if people don't want to be helped, let alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said,``Can you imagine a city that's not harmful? ''
I decided, I was just going to respond to the people, and I invented a system called Facebook company where you never start anything, you never motivate anyone, but it becomes a servant of the local passion, the service of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what does you do? You shut up.
It's never coming to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of the location.
We don't work from the offices.
We meet in a coffee . We got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help you find knowledge, because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of reaching a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, do we hear them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never attend, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they've identified.
So planning has this blind dot.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family's family doctor, the business doctor of the business, which is established with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in the coffee table, and it helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of winning life.
I started this as a test in hopes, the city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this constant garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in the road, and the government came to me to ask,``How can you do that?
How can you do it?"And I said,``I did something very, very, very difficult.
I'm street and listened to them ."So -- then the government says,``Make it back ."We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drumbikey, one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed at 96, a few years ago.
Peter Drumbia was a philosophy professor before we involved in business, and this is what Peter Drummit says:``planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company . ''
planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you're going to rebuild Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to join up with you.
You have to offer them conflicts, privacy, it has to be fantastic when you help them, and then you'll get to you, you'll come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show up this morning?
Apparently local people . That's what you have applaud.
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial fuel fossil fossil fossil fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The brakes as a way of sustaining machinery is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we nurture, cure, educate, we transport, we communicate to seven billion people in a sustainable way.
There's no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent technology for green revolution? The universities? Forget it! Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
There's an adorable story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There were a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in 1800.
And in 1800, this group of people came together, and they speculate what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was united: the city of New York didn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and pointed out, if population keeps growing up to this rate, to move to the population of New York to the surroundings, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already running in dung . So, in 1800, they were figuring out this dirty technology that would overwhelm New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, the United States appeared 100 automobiles , 110.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed, and there were very few, scared, factories in parking places.
The Drugs, Michigan . Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you confidence.
Otherwise, you will not come to conversation with you.
Then you have to offer them an absolute, dedicated, enthusiastic service.
And then, you will have to tell you the truth about it to understand.
The smallest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing, and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 icons of the Carnegie world, Western, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: No one was started by one person.
It's never the word``me ,"but the word``us"-- 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started . ''
Nobody starts a company alone . Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have facilitators, who come from an environment of small businesses sitting in coffee, in bars along their dedicated dedicated people who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this epidemic, someone who would ask you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, can you sell? Can you look for the money? ''
\" Oh, no, I can't do that ."`` I'd like you to look for someone? ''
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People who surround us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automatic, plants and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their apartments?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape better?
How do we share our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadow to lovers, drunk and sounds from the centuries of a city and trust in a city.
There's a parade in New Orleans, and there's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with most of the most abandoned properties of the United States.
I lived near this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was Joan, like a mother for me.
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a deep gratitude for life.
He gave clarity to the significant things of my current life.
But I gain for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to leave the day to day and forget the really important one.
So with the help of old and new friends, it transformed the wall of this house abandoned into a giant blackboard and painted on her phrases to complete:``Before I die I want...''
So the trains could take a chalk, reflect about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was packed and kept covering.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
\" Before I die I want to be judged by piracy ."`` Before I die I want to sit in the line of date change . ''
\" Before I die I want to sing for millions of people . ''
\" Before I die I want to plant a tree . ''
\" Before I die I want to live outside the network . ''
\" Before I die I want to hug it again . ''
\" Before I die I want to go to somebody's rescue . ''
\" Before I die I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space became constructive, and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh, they destroyed me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that one is not alone . It's about understanding our neighbors in new and scalable ways . It's about giving birth to reflection and contemplation, and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit, and now they've been made in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
We showed together the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve perspective and remember life is brief and delicate.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think about climate death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters to us as individuals, and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
This is 22 years old, it's high and very handsome.
It doesn't talk, but it transmit better than some of the best speakers.
remix knows what love is.
It's incredibly shared by what happens.
It's not remarkable . It doesn't look at the skin color.
It doesn't care about the religious differences and look at this: never mind.
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to test words that I didn't even remember, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old . It's high . It's very nice.
It has the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year that every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, put my arm in my arm during the first episode of the Telescopes and the Lady Gaga birthday.
Don't you seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the notion of normal society, they're often ignored and uncomfortable.
But what I pushed my heart and strength my soul was that even if that was the case, although they didn't consider them within the ordinary, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term``autism ,"it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual, it's made in a different way, from there that remix is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism is diagnosed, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there's no known cause.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came into the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
He screamed a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
And he was living and he kept in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that had between media.
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the edges, the frustration and the endless hyperactivity, there was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a child that looked at the world without prejudice, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize it's things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
The normal passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact that it's different doesn't mean that any is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Rem and Sam and you, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- are a gift! Every one of us has a gift inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normality is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness, progress and change dies at the time where we're trying to be like others.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it should have been Alice in the Marshall country.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a communications class to engineering students.
He was scared . Really . scared of these students with their great minds, his big books and their big words and words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice had to have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, and I was amazed with the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges, from energy in the environment and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please talk about it.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that their science is sexy, and that its engineering is attractive.
First question to answer: what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
We don't just tell you that they study the problems, but they study the problems, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And when you're describing their science, care about jargon.
jargon is a obstacles for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say``space and temperature ,"but why not to say``space and time"that is much more accessible to us?
Now, making it accessible is not the same thing that makes them dumb.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies . They're ways to deceive and get excited with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of bullet.
You've wondered why they're called``bullets"? What do bullets do? The bullets kill, and they kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the area of our brain language and overwhelmed us.
Instead, this film of example from Gene Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of the rainforest is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple, legal phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that match our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's described.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, all the means, celebrate with simple . Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Oxford English Dictionary is``sympathy . ''
Just because it sounds very well.
And``sympathy"means``dishonest policy . ''
Although there was a 19th century newspaper editor that defined it much better when he said,``A sandwich ,"is that it's looking for a public charge without matter, platform or principle, and that, when he wins, it gets it for the mere use of a metaphorical verb . ''
I have no idea what it means``characteristic . ''
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and all politicians know they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until, for example , 1777 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the name of British Cross, who faced Parliament.
They put it in the London Tower, and he was incarcerated, but he had enough courage to confront them, and at the end had such a popular support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase of the phrase``so"`` so"like the metal.
Most of you think it's literal.
It's not . It's a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was debate in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions were presented that they could have flourishing.
Some of you wanted to call it``Washington of State ,"and others,``His Air George Washington ,"and other``Defense George Washington ,"and``The Freedom of the U.S. village . ''
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it``King . ''
They thought it was a quality.
And not even with it was moral, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain deadline.
And it could have served.
Everybody gets immensely married, because this debate was preparing for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor senator, and he always wrote,``still with this topic . ''
What caused the delays, and it was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The Republic House didn't want Washington to be drunk.
They didn't want to call it King in if he was giving him to him or her assistant ideas.
So, they wanted to give them the most modest, most insignificant and more unfortunate title that they came up with.
And that title was``President . ''
President . They didn't invent the title . There was already before, but it only meant``somebody who plays a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much bigger than the term``foreman"or``supermarket . ''
There were a full president of the little colleagues of little colonialism and government fractions, but it was really an insignificant title.
And that's why the Senate offers.
They said,``It's ridiculous, we can't call it president . ''
\" This guy has to sign treaties and gather with foreign dictionaries . ''
\" And who will be serious with a very ridiculous and insignificant degree as President of America? ''
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't measure.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite as far as I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been officially reflected the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, hoping that the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is temporary -- it's possible that we keep waiting for 120,000 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to leave you, is that the U.S. President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have been given to the degree of great.
So, at the end, it won the Senate.
They got their research title.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But, you know how many nations have a president now?
And it's all because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear heads, etc.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because no one is going to feel humility when they tell them they're now the U.S. President.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I'd like to leave you with.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually, it really changes the words that these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is charged of heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of male cough and stones with primitive tools.
Like the other, I carry a cheap light of ink light holding into the head with this pink elastic, and I can barely distinguish the radiations that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
My hand and all of a sudden I remember a minority that I met earlier, that lost control and fell countless meters in that pit.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole risking their lives without paying and reward, and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do, because they're prey of slavery.
Over the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition in the Vancouver Peace Summit.
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met an intervention of Free the Selectlers, an NGO who was dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew it existed in the world, but not such a degree.
When we finished talking to me very bad, honestly I was embarrassed to ignore this attacking of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I became a stomach of the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of Free the Slides' and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
A few, even, I considered them my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty tricks.
A conservative calculation says that there are currently more than 27 million people located in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced during all of the trafficking slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a $50,000 current.
However, today, you can enslave entire families by generations by $18 dense debt.
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false education promises and better work, and then finding that they're forced to work without paying, under threat of violence, and they can't escape.
Today the slavery operates in the trade: goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable.
Slavery exists in almost everybody, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met brick furnaces.
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or Darwin's hell.
Insanized in a temperature of 54, men, women, children, in fact, entire families wrapped up in a heavy pile of dust stacked mechanically bricks in their heads, up to 18 at the time, and they take them from the additional furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
They're developed by the monkey and the tiredness work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours a day.
There was no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe district made that origami was pretty intrinsic.
So they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to revive it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera receives a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces, I wanted to cry, but the Abanology who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said,``Lisa, don't do it . Don't do it here . ''
And I was very clearly explained that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on Free the keys and work inside the system for their release and trust you would get it.
And in terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my desert heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles by mountains, to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big planes were heavier than the kids who would charge them, and the kids hold them on their heads with homemade straps made of sticks, strings and rags.
It's hard to predict something so overwhelming.
How can we influence something so insidious, but so ubiquitous?
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without paying because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages reclaim their freedom, the climbers were totally burned their homes.
When I hear the word slavery, we often thought about sexual traffic, and because of this global consciousness, I was warned to be hard to me work with security in this particular business.
At Kathmandu, I was struck by women who had previously been sexual slaves.
I was driven by some angel stairs that were giving this dirty, fundamental light.
It wasn't exactly a brothel.
It was more a restaurant.
Reserved in the office, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small, private rooms, where the women's slaves with their girls and children, some of just seven years are forced to entertain customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse by their customers.
On my feet, I remember having a scary fear, and at that instant, I could barely imagine what's supposed to be stuck in that hell.
I only had a output: the stairs where I came in.
There were no backdoor doors.
There were no windows enough to climb.
Those people don't have a slave, and because we play a topic so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people located in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that we often relate to slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families packed in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The hands of black are from the father, the teenagers of blue and red, of their children.
They mix together in these big barrels and dip the silk on the liquid to the elbow, but the temptation is toxic.
My performer told me their stories.
\" We don't have freedom ,"they said.
\" We still hope, yet, to get out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay our work . ''
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children enslaved in the Volta lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a ship, two older brothers, some younger children, makes sense, right?
Wrong.
Kids are separated from their fated families, disappeared and forced to work very much in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up, it was shaking; he feared his little canoe out.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the trees submerged in the Volvo lake often attract networks and children, fatigue and fear, they throw into water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are drowned.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee, and as the whole life has been treated with cruelty, it's traditionally treating the younger slaves under its command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they raised the latest networks, but they had been working from one.
In the night and sentence.
And it has to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued in a fishing village.
I met it in a shelter where I wrote the Sliders' respectability to slavery victims.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
Driving for a road in Ghana with Free the Slowly, an Abandarat partner with his two-wheeler engine and spreads our car and played the window.
It asked us to follow it through a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, he inspired us to come out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then I pointed out this sort of visible one, and he said,``This is the road, this is the road . Go . ''
As we started to go down, we took the streams that blocked the path, and after we walk around an hour, we found that the path was upset by the recent rains, so I put the photos team on my head as we drop on these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the second path ended abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with enslaved workers.
A lot of women had kids tied to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they walked in water poisoned with mercury.
The market is used in the extraction process.
These miners are enslaved in one pit in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were packed in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 meters, and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they would grab the stone so they can extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong and violent men, but, if we look closer to the margin, we see a lot less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injury, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this museum ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the training for mercury in a few years.
This is Mario . When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When you die his uncle, Mario inherited the debt of uncle that force him to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, I had worked on the 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so serious that doctors said it should be amputated.
In addition to that, Mario has tuberculosis, and not about that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Still, he dreams with being released and educated with local activists' help, and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will take testimony from them and we will do everything to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines . They are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think of these so many beautiful, battered people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images wake up a force in who you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force is going to turn a fire and that that fire shine light on the slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do an app math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom it does: we're like management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm trying to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We're going to give us the virtues of the ballet and the click dancers that we'll see later.
But the whale demand a degree of extraordinary training, high level of dexterity, and probably some initial app that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's evil destroy gradually this extraordinary skill, as it does with my friend Jane Steven who, at his time, was a barrier dancer.
In the last few years, a lot of treatment has been progress.
However, there are 6.3 million people in the world that are sick and they have to deal with an incurable, the shaky, stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in objective ways, and ultimately the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective and closed metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson and other disorders of movement there are no biological markers, so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if the patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult journey to the clinic . What if patients could make the test themselves?
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as not conventional to try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all virtuous as my friend Jane Steven.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows someone healthy as it emits the sounds by talking . We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound, and we all have the genes necessary . The Feminist, for example.
And, like the ballet, it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that takes a kid to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as they vibrate, and as the Parkinson affects the limbs, it also affects vocal organs.
On the bottom of the bottom, you can see an example of a surface of the vocal chords.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal, weakness and stiffness.
The speech becomes more quiet and appropriate after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials? Well, both of them are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive . They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are accurate . Okay, but also the examples based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be authorized.
They're done very quickly, it's about 30 seconds like a lot.
And they're a minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets a cost so low, it comes to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the routine check.
With high frequency monitoring, we could get objective data.
We could make massive cost of low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, effective checks on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biologists of disease before it's too late.
So, by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's vocal Initiative.
Together and Apple and Peters, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We've got accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Anyone, with or without Parkinson's, can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you . Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, will say who's healthy and who isn't?
What would you take out of these samples?
Max literature: Yes, yeah . What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease . TR: Sure.
MM: You see, some people may not happen . They may not end up.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that's collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, because we're looking for lighting the confusion factors in pursuit of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now?
MM: Much more than that.
Actually, my student Thomas, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now it's shown that it works in the mobile phone network also, what it makes the project . Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Ninety and nine . Well, it's an improvement.
MM: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much . Max literature, public.
MM: Thank you, Tom.
Before March , 2011, I made photographic portraits in New York City.
We are pale creatures, gray.
We're hiding in the darkness, in courts without windows, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make thin light models even more thin, the perfect skin, even more perfect, we do the impossible, possible and crime on the press all the time, but some of us are really artistic artists with a lot of years of expertise and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11 , 2011, I saw from my home, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
A little bit later, an organization where it was voluntary, there Hans Volta, was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I went to Oxford.
It's a little town of fishermen located in the performance of the almost 50,000 people, one of the first people that are affected by the wave.
The water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles inland.
As you can imagine, the village was devastating.
We take rubble rubble debris.
We cleaned schools . Let's take the mud and leave lists to be renewed and rehabilitation.
We take tons and tons of fish dead, apple, the local factory.
We were born, and we loved.
For weeks, both volunteers and neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and Courters.
Everybody did the same thing.
You'll pick them up and take them to different places of people around to keep them guard.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered.
As they were on the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in an assessment center.
He helped clean the normal bathrooms, giant dancers.
This place turned out to be also the place of the people where the performance center collected the photos.
They took them out, and I had the honor that that day trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizons, but it wasn't until I had my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years, some of them were still at the top of the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that trait and repair that paradox and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try it.
So we started taking the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too surprising, but where the water had documented the face of the girl had to be fixed with a lot of accuracy and delicious.
Otherwise, that child wouldn't have the same aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the Spanish photo.
Over the course of time, they came up with more pictures, and they needed more reflections, so it came back in Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
At the end of two weeks, I had 150 people wish to join.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Richard, a neighboring village in Northern York.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporary photographic libraries that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that they were struggling to deliver it is a different story, depending upon the challenge of photos.
I could imagine an hour . I could make weeks.
It could make months.
It had to be drawing virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, with algae, even with oil, all of that together with the time of time, continue to destroy them, so clean by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't take the picture unless it was clean, dry and had been released by his owner.
We were lucky with the cleanliness by hand.
We have the guide of an admirable neighbor.
It's very easy to harm the photos anymore.
As a Western once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
He had begun to clean her himself, but he stopped realizing that he gave them even more.
It also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to rebuild, we were able to solar the images in a single picture and take the whole picture.
When he picked his pictures, it shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues in their husband found the photos in a firemen station between the rubble, pretty far from where their home used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers into the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the Sirens sounded.
Their small kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave her photos, his youngest son turned 14.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could come back to, something that could remember the past that hadn't been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us, hundreds of them helped us clean up more than 13,000 photographs the vast majority -- the vast majority came back to their owners.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us go back to 90 families of completely restricted photos and returns.
Over this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the printer for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're graders of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take, but the first thing we would get to look for.
It was about this project, of restoring small pieces of humanity, giving someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the players.
Some of them connected with something bigger, giving something out, using their talent for something that's not perfect models of perfect skin.
To end up, I'd like to read this email . I sent it 65 the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was talking, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in images.
One particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathered around a baby, shocked me, because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my newborn daughter, hangs out of our wall.
In the entire world, in every few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doctor Edison inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a million second.
But now , 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present a new kind of photograph: photography -- a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the corners, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and you go up and hit it in a billionth of a second, and it's, in several microseconds, to create a packet of photons of just a millimeter wide.
And that package of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
So if we take that bullet and this package of photons and shoot on this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this bottle?
What's the aspect of light in slow motion?
Now, all of this -- remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a standard is what happens to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
And Coca-Cola doesn't add this research . There's a lot of things in this film, and you can demonstrate this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet, comes into the bottle with a packet of photons that starts to go through it, and inside, it starts to spread.
Part of the light is broken, it goes to the table, and we start seeing these calls.
Many of the photons finally get to the lid, and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, waves travel around the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several blocks, that the reflecting is concentrated.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet, and we make it take the same distance, and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week, actually, a year.
It would be a very boring film of a bullet lens in motion.
And how about a dead nature?
You can see the waves that are going to be taken out of the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, thought, from a petrology at the same time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato again, you'll notice that as light comes out of the tomato, it's still brilliant . It's not dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light bounce inside, and it comes back after several billion seconds.
In the future, when this membrane is in its cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure, so it's just going to get some light.
We send that bullet, that packet of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very crude sync, we take those gigabytes of data and we put them computers together to create those feminists that I showed you.
We can take all of these data data and process them in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
What if a new power of a superhero future allowed him to see after the corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door . So bounce, enter the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bounce.
It's not science fiction . We've built it.
On the left, it's our membrane.
Behind the wall there is a nest, and we will bounce light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Commandments.
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our character, it has unique capabilities.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is, what distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a picture in a gross, which, you see on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we'll put them together and try to analyze multiple light trees, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's going on the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build inaliation to see the inside of the body by surrounding the oceans, and the same thing for capitalism.
But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about photography as a new visualization model to solve the problems of health imaging problems.
Just like Dr. Edgar, he himself became a scientist, became art science, an art of strangers.
I realized that all of the gigabytes of data we collected every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
It will create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and code code.
And we look at those waves . Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few seconds of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the lid, these are away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects . Einstein would have been looking at this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
By applying the corresponding of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
It's time . Thank you.
Hi . This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can get a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, upload it to South and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm an 1984 boy in Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting a change.
This is the fall of 1989 . So imagine if all these people who were protesting in search for a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who of people have a mobile phone here?
Get them down.
Raise your mobile phones, keep them up!
Get them out . An Android, Bluefin, wow!
It's a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about me, my mobile phone, and how life changed.
I'll talk about this.
This is 35,000 lines of information.
Bat data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U . Commission presented a directive.
It's the Discriminal Data Director.
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet provider, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who's called an email to whom.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or the Internet provider.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said,``We don't want this . ''
They said they didn't want this data collection.
We want the authority in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said,``We don't want this . ''
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to Berlin streets and said,``Freedom, not fear . ''
And some even said that this would be Stage 2.0.
The State was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the mobile phone?
So I asked my phone, Democrat TV, who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, that please send me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I was asked to ask, and I didn't get a concrete answer . It was all blah, blah.
But then I said,``I want to have this information because you're protecting my life.
So I decided to start a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Duke TV said no, we will not give you this information.
At the end we signed an agreement.
I would take the demand and they send me the information I asked.
In the meantime, the German constitutional tribunal failed inspiration for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly blood on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand acres of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file . Okay.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a bit skeptical: what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I'm, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to come out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, along with Keith Online and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom up and go back, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I'm from French in train to colony, and how often I call the journey.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other, and we end up with this great network of communications.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what hour they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the State had known who participated in this protest, and if the State had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And in consequence, it's not the fall of the iron of iron.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But authenticity and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight the self-determination.
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home, they give your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and it's not past.
When you go home, give it to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store certain information, you don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones, it serves you to remember that you have to fight the self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call Massachusetts Zarina, and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, addressing the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and so I'm plastic all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting.
and Muhammad Al.
The P C. is not genetic.
It's not cool or it can contract.
No one would send the uterus of my mother and not the contract because my parents were siblings, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I'm warn you, I'm not inspiring.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go back.
Christmas glasses, they're in the mall, they're driving in circles in search for parking and what you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think,``God, can I be at least a little bit disabled? ''
Also, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P C. is just one of them.
There's a population of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Cliphen, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initials.
I also love if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I could.
Many people with brain palsy don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the``can't be . ''
And the mantra of my father was,``You can do it; dancing your pants . ''
If my three older sisters cleaned, I cleaned.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents sued the school system, and they made sure that I was also, and if we didn't take all the main notes, we all received my mother's sneakers.
My father taught me to walk at five years by putting my heel in their feet and just walking.
Another technique that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to chase it.
The server I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah . The first day in the kindergarten garden, he was walking like a boxing champion that has received a lot of hits.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs, and they keep being all of the family . I think nobody realized we were not Italian.
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use``hatred Muslims"as a campaign slogan.
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry about hunger during the Ramadan.
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I'm going to get rid of the dawn when it's very easy.
He was dancing in Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway . It's crazy . My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heel, so I can walk with heel.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends used heel, I too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jerry, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine all summer, we become Madonna.
And in summer vacation, my father was often trying to kill me, so I drank a deer milk, and I got warm cups on my back, and I was immersed at the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burned my eyes and I thought,``It works, it works! ''
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but before I make yoga, it was a supportive comedian who couldn't stand [unclear].
And now I can hold on my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at General Hospital television.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the United States, University of the State of Arizona, because I walked in all the quota.
It was like the pet lamp of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the least intelligent tasks, I took the maximum note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene of the crystal zoo, my teachers cried.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the U.N. decided to make a work called Balkan Babylon.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral palsy.
I was a girl with cerebral palsy.
So I started screaming at four winds,``In the end I'll have a role!
I have brain palsy!
In the end! In the end!
Thank God all-powerful, I'm free . ''
He didn't get the paper . They gave it to Sheryl Brown.
I went to intervene running at the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking him why, and she told me that because they believed that they couldn't do the risk stunts.
And I said,``Excuse me, if I can't do risk stunts, it can't be the character . ''
It was a role that literally was born, and they gave it to an actress without cerebral palsy.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of hearing actors without disability for disabled roles.
When I graduated, I went home, and my first actor tour was kind of extra on a phone.
My dream got real.
And I knew that it would be``partner"to``better crazy friend"in a manuscript.
Instead, I stayed there as a vase, I didn't see me more than the new one, and it was obvious to me that the principal directors didn't hire, no white actors, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at Google Goldberg, Rose Barbara, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedy.
That's why I made me humor.
In my first tour, I took New York City comic comics from New Jersey to New Jersey, and I would never forget the face of the first cartoon that took when I fell at the high speed of the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had cerebral palsy.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the East East, without censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first monopoly in the Arab world.
I never like to pick up the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother's brother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Feltane comedy Festival in New York City, now in her 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Americans in the media, and at the same time remind them to the repair directors that sweat and Arabic are not synonymous.
integrating Arabs was much easier than fighting the stigma of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the cable news program behind Keith Olympics.
I walked into a graduation dance, dragged me to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
And I looked at the principal and I said,``Excuse me, can you give me another chair? ''
She looked at me and said,``Five, four, three, two...''
And we were live!
So I went into the desk of the speaker to get out of the screen during the segment, and when I finished the interview, I was pale.
I had my opportunity in the end, and I was describing it . I knew they didn't invite me.
But not only Mr. Obama came back to invite me, but I was a full-time participant, and I pasted my chair.
One fun thing that I learned with Keith Obama was that people on the Internet are Scotland.
It's said that kids are cruel, but they never had a little girl or a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became teased.
I saw clips online with comments like,``Why is it that he said,``Why is it that he was like? ''
\" Is it rhetorical? ''
And my favorite,``Poor blogger terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for her . ''
A communist suggested even to add my disability to my rsum: scientist, comedian, paralyzed.
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do Beijing, then Ben can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled is -- yes, clapping, man . Come on.
Discoveries are the largest minority in the world, and most upsettine in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown with media, I don't think it was.
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our kids well.
My journey travels me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk down the red carpet on the line of the Sushi Lesis tablet, and the Larry Argentine care.
I got to act in a film with Adam Sandel and to work with my idol, the incredible Dave Matthews.
I traveled the world,``Arabs have become crazy . ''
I was desperate in representation of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded``Massachusetts' Children ,"a charity charity to give the Palestinian refugee children a little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in live, and I devote this talk to his memory.
Stay on peace.
I call Massachusetts Zarina, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town in Southern Somalia.
This town is near Mongolia.
The drought pushes the little village to poverty and the brink of innovation.
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, Moonic, the Somalia capital.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no future perspectives.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of Mongolia.
After maybe a serious year, nothing.
A day is about a gentleman who offers him to take it, after dinner, to fight it.
He knows a dynamic group of people who give him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, his family.
They present a young woman.
It's finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mongolia, under a blue sky, he bursts a bomb.
That little boy of that little town with the dreams of the great care was suicide terrorism, and that dynamic group of people were to Shabaab, a terrorist organization connected with al Qaeda.
So, how did the story of a child in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him immortal?
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing I got.
And this was the first thing that I was calling the``waiting period . ''
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the marginalized, young urban urban urban users who have riots in Johannesburg, desperate riots in London, who look for something beyond``waiting period . ''
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the history of hope, the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, Moonic , 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to Mongolia last month, and I went to visit the Madrid Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being to that hospital accountable, thinking,``What if I had never gone? ''
What if I was forced to be in that same period of waiting?
Would I have become terrorist?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in Mogadishu that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders in a corporate grave.
He gathered about 90 Somali leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges that the city face.
One of the young people in the room was in the room.
He went to Monday University, he graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because it was a graduate, unemployed university, it was the perfect white target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They look for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mongolia, the biggest obstacle to get from the point A to B is streets.
Tens of civil war years have completely destroyed the wind system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize.
And you saw an opportunity and the leverage.
He started a motorcycle company.
He started linking motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
He bought 10 engines, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this different story?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the waiting period.
I quote young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohammed, a flower.
I was helping me train some of the young people in the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mogadishu has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your wedding, we were used from plastic sent from abroad.
If you asked someone,``When was the last time you saw fresh flowers? ''
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be,``Never . ''
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a business of landscape and design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of Moonic, and he started growing up the touches, languages, who said, could survive the hard climate of Mogadishu.
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in Mogadishu in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mongolia.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the proverbial pink.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be a change of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identify business solutions for local problems.
So inspired young people and creating a business culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and put in their business.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, to give up the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
To me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park, this is how he calls it, when he's created, transform the way people see their city.
You've got children from the street to help rent and keep the buttons for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the``waiting period . ''
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, they turn the young people in entrepreneurs, they include and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Peace Parks than the authors and``waiting periods . ''
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad in Radion Mountains, an area farmer in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun made the leaves shine as a virtual, and not to be the way we followed, we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to put that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a record with a beautiful Christian lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed, there was a dump, from about four square meters with apples of aluminum, aluminum paper balls, and old alarm.
And I was angry, I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The companies that were too lazy to pull out what they had brought, who thought it was going to clean their garbage?
That question followed with me, and it's simply a little bit.
Who clean our trash?
No matter how they organize or where you put the``ours ,"who clean our garbage in Istanbul?
Who clean our garbage in Rio or Paris or London?
Here in New York, the Clean Department clean our trash, at the reason of 11,000 tons of waste and two thousand tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that load?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked around his tracks and interviewed people in offices and installations across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an intruder.
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a garbage collector.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks . I drove them.
And it operated the mechanics and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as profitable as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong, you're used quickly.
It costs a lot to be used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies followed the weight to take their body tons of trash every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, waste collection is one of the most dangerous occupation in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day, and they're pushing around you.
They just want to happen, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and causes terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the line and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get you to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
She never stopped coming.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste collection is the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of the waste efficient and effective every day, this starts to disagree from your container and your inherent dangers threaten us in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and they start harming.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for what the economy engines start to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, just signal its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average daily speed.
And with that, I mean simply the speed that we used to move at the time.
We usually don't worry about us, or repair, clean or take with us our coffee cup, our bag of the jaw, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them up, we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will come out of it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help reduce stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His job, I think, is almost logical.
They're on the street every day, rhythmic.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us leaves us to save ourselves, from our own waste, our waste, and that flow is always supposed to stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard the fluid of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs running, and there was a man doing her paper recycling journey as all the Wednesday migrations did.
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just nodded, and he said,``We're going to be fine.
We're going to be fine . ''
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste collection, and I went back to that man.
It's called Paul, we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Pauling was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts, to reward the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
Murder waste, which we think when we talk about garbage, represent three percent of the number of waste waste.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see to someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, just a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to think of our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of the Ethiopia capital, Addis Ababa.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was,``I want to get running . ''
And after seeing some of these buildings, there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to rest.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame trying to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really engaging with the old market, which is this open-source structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small marketers.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a building, several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by the inspiration of the site, which is located in a very much growth zone in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries of the building.
And this spreads with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that is automated, by its own shape and rain and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responded to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a paradoxic concrete shell to allow the entrance of the air, and also from light, but in a filtered way.
And then we're inspired in these beautiful buttons of Ethiopian dresses.
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the facade.
We're building that with these little preferenced pieces that are the windows that let go on air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is very complementary with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas, it didn't really make the development to convince the developers because they thought,``That's not a commercial center . It's not what we asked . ''
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because in the end of account, there were more local ones to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no longer needed to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy supply for the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting photographs on the roof.
And then under those panels, we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that create this urban oasis.
And these pieces on the roof, that in a set collect water for the health care.
It's expected for the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of building.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest I had designed, I needed not only understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the middle, a $1,000 structure that was surrounded by a wall with two actual access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was to expand the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors interconnected with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation be for an apartment in the middle climate?
And it's north, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we put a scheme that made sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with cats, and then in the low plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to bounce the space of the space that's occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and fix, and make such an activity like running a two-year-old race in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the local communities and local economies to the same pace that buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture, looking for simple but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class . It was so remarkable, as all the new girls look like.
I had great amounts of very bright hair, and a little set of pencils, nice . It was super strong for states of states, very good for office.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister.
I was a day after the exit of school . It was a little late, and I hid me in the girls' toilet.
When the coast was stripped, I went out, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my master's book the book of grades.
And then, I did.
I altered the ratings of my rival, just a little bit, just some.
All the way . And I gave me back the book to the box . But, to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a frenzy, he ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of God and myself a row of this, just for being there, since I could ...
I still surprised me what I did.
I don't understand how the idea arose.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was all desperately obvious.
They never found me.
But most of all, I'm curious about the reason that I was bothered that this little girl, so small, it was so good for origami.
I'm intrigued by jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so pressing.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates . The blue birds are very prone.
We know that the jealousy is the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzed loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
And so, you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which they study the jealousy in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helen, it wouldn't have``Odysseus . ''
There wouldn't be king jealous, no``A thousand and a Night . ''
There was no Shakespeare.
They would disappear the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing``The Noise and The Force ,"no``Gate"or``Pier ."We would lose``Mad Bolian"and``Anna K . ''
Without jealousy, there's no Proust . I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost it has all of them.
This year, a hundred years from his masterpiece,``In search for lost time ,"the most exhaustive study of sexual cells and also ordinary competition, mine, everything we could have, and thinking about Proust, we have the sentimental details, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a humiliated machine on your lava.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget what it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia Wood said they were as hard as a cat triangle.
I don't know what the cat strip is, but we assume it's super.
Let's see why they go so well, the novel and the jealousy, the jealousy and Prostheter.
It will be very obvious like the jealousy, which are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their implementation, are a good narrative base?
I don't know . I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being a storyteller and audience, we know exactly what details to include, to clear the knife, right?
The jealousy makes us all amateur novels, and that's something that Proust understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give birth to another, maybe right now . ''
And he starts saying to himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every fresh charm that Gwen detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that healthy and Proust, they were notoriously jealous.
You know, Proust's boyfriend would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so jealous to recognize that it's a hard job . Right?
The jealousy is exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion . You have to feed it.
And what are the jealousy?
The skies are nurtured from information.
The jealousy uses the details.
The seeds like the big quantities of bright hair and the cute and little crayons.
The skies are nutrient from photos.
That's why Institute is so successful, it Proust links well the language with the language of the jealousy.
When Gwen is in his jealousy agony, suddenly he heard behind the doors and bribe to the services of his lover, then defined those behaviors.
He says,``Look, I know you think this is revolting, but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or look at a memorial . ''
He says,``They're scientific research with real intellectual value . ''
So it's trying to prove that the jealousy looks unfortunate, and they make us seem absurd, but in their memory, they're pursuit of knowledge, search of truth, a painful truth . in fact, what Proust is, the more painful the truth, the better.
Pain, humiliation, loss: These were the pathways to the wisdom of Proust.
He says,``One woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us a much deeper range of feelings that a wise man can be interested in . ''
Is it telling us we're going to look for cruel women?
No . I think it's trying to say that the dolphins reveal us.
Is there any other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals us our aggressive, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that taught us how to look carefully so peculiar?
Freud wrote about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was fooled.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
Well, she was innocent; everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he looked for things that did his wife, not realizing, involuntary behaviors.
Is it sound too much, or accidentally broken with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the storyteller of his wife's unconscious.
novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the dolphins make us look with intensity but no accuracy.
In fact, the more intense we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the dolphins are getting us to make violent or illegal acts.
The jealousy drives us to behave in fully unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman in Michael of 52 years old was captured for having created a false account in Facebook from which he was sent out, horrible messages for himself, for a year.
For a year . Every year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when it or this, you react with admiration.
Because we're realistic.
How huge, albeit unfortunate, creativity . Right?
It's like a novel.
It's like a novel of a Highway Higgs novel.
Higgs is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of``strangers in a train"and``The Talent Mr. Rice ,"books who are trying to how the jealousy, confused our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the theater realm, the membrane that separates what might be, can be drill in an instant . .
Take Tom Rielly, his most famous character.
Tom Rielly is going to lose or want what you have to get out of your self, and you're going to be able to get out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor . You respond to your name, you take your rings, you take your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take Tom Rielly's route.
I can't give you all around the world, as much as sometimes I wanted.
It's a pity, because we live in envy times.
We live in the ice times.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where is currency the currency? Right?
The novels show us the output? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to Bahage Street, and we asked by Sherrible Holls.
When people think about Homosayes, they think about curse in the Morrance Professor, that criminal genius.
But I've always practiced [unclear] ]], the Research face chief of Scott Sardmir who needs delicars desperately, needs the genius of hotels, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lesters needs its help, but it's reserve, and bubble with bitterness in the fall of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in``The Air of The Six Spains ,"once Holy Hollywood comes in, he goes down to everybody with his solution, Stevens comes back to Hollywood, and he says,``We're not jealous, Mr. Homos.
We're proud of you . ''
And it tells him that there's no person in Stockholm Sarney who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Hollywood in the story . I think this is very emotional . That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat jealousy as a geometry problem, without emotion.
You know, in a Hindu minute, it's the opposite side of Lesters.
The next minute they're at the same side.
Suddenly, Lesterland allows you to admire that idea of being the answer.
Could it still be so simple?
What if the jealousy is really a geometry issue, just one question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of each other.
We can release with it.
But I like the contingency plans.
So as we wait for that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction for us.
Only the fiction described the jealousy.
fiction used to the domesticated, invites them to the table.
And look at what you add: the sweet Reserval, the terrifying Tashamma Rio, the Louis Parash, the same Marcel Proust.
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 , 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo 11, and he went on on the Times's Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray surface gray was the culmination of a conventional collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization in peace times in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spends about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the Apollo 1 crew.
But before the Apollo Program funded , 24 men traveled to the moon.
dozens were walking on their surface, which Alice after Armstrong died last year, is now the oldest.
Why were they?
They didn't have a lot of back : 381 pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 would emphasize later, a new sense of the small and the fragility of our common home.
Why were it? The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets, that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962 give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: Some questions, why did the moon?
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would you scale the highest mountain?
35 years ago, why will I fly over the Atlantic?
Why do Richard play Texas?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Portile: For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the East War . .
At the time, the strongest emotion was to wonder before the transcendence of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do.
The landing in the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological triumph.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
And in the middle of the century, the police is eradicated, and it's eliminated.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin Toronto in 1970 called``astronomical force . ''
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a sailing ship, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10 crew, and the optimistic joy on the power of technology has been evaporated by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be intractable.
I remember watching Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't look at the escape tube called the rocket Saturn V.
I knew vividly that this would be the last Monday mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from``Something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology"has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We heard it during the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists had been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhones, apps and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated sale.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a remarkable explanation in Silicon Valley, which trust you have created less ambitious companies than those of the years in which Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Gene.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, the incentives that risk capitalists provide the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment causes the creation of transformational ideas by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their frozen point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that they could come out in 10 years.
Covers have always had problems to invest in technologies such as energy, which need a huge capital, and whose development is long-term . They have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic.
The coal and the natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind energy, and oil is cheaper than biodiversity.
We want some alternative energy sources that can compete in price . Don't exist.
Now, technologists, business and economists agree about what politics and international treaties would incentivize the development of alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the coal of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famines are a result of failure in the food repair.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis crisis that affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like harvest, or systems for storage and food repair, but there will be famine as there are bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes smell a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terrible resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, it seems to have found effective and viable treatments.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have to be present: political leaders and population must want to solve the problem; institutions must support the solution; it has to really be really about a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, with those criteria.
But it's an irreducible model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There's no galaxy competition like the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who smells the hard and the dangerous, and there's no popular science mythology like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon, it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days old.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't need the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become cliche of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a claims: there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second one is one goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a task: we should recover trust.
I think that we call it out, the goal, and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a recycling, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of the claims, why do people think that trust has diminished?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I urge to think that it may have been diminished in some activities or institutions, and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can take the opinion surveys, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there aren't many evidence of it.
That is, the people who were discovered 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians are still inspiring the same mistrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite reliable: judges, nurses.
The rest are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway.
But is this obvious evidence?
What the opinion surveys are, of course, opinions.
What else can you register?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they're asked certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Trust in teachers?
Now, if someone would ask you,``Are you trust them?
Do you trust the fishermen?
Do you trust the primary teachers? ''
You would probably start to ask,``To do what? ''
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question,``Well, trust you in some, but in others . ''
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of officer, working or kind of person, is going to be uniform in every case.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but in no way to drive school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is differences, why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to force the good inherent judgment to the fact that we trust something or someone.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal I would chase.
I would be willing to have more trust in what it is, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a paraphrasia not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who laid their savings with the very closely called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too confident.
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Trust depressing or denial with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it, he says, yes, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain aspects.
And I think in order to make a judgment, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competitive? Are they honest? Are you responsible?
And if you find that a person is competent in the mental matter, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if you're not responsible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but it didn't trust them to take a letter to the email, because they're forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competition.
And I'm really glad to say that I don't have many friends who are competent and responsible but extremely unfair.
If it's like that, I still haven't noticed.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust.
Trust is the answer.
trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party, and he said,``Well, you'll see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative paper than to put the part in it . ''
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional, that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee trustworthiness and the transparency tests, is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is, you know, the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the midwives, to tell you that``market cards ,"as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
Everything, all of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more reliable, and that things would be different if we're trying to be worthy of trust and we will transport the people that we are trustworthy, and if we're trying to determine whether other people or officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy.
Third, task.
To call the task rebuild trust, it puts things back into the back.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in definition, is distinctive because they hate other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough, so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't deceive, usually, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to bring a lot of fun evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That's every day, everywhere, it does the common people, the officials, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks says I can give them back without giving explanations.
I take them up and get my money back, or you change them by the color I want.
That's great . I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust on what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing to is not really hard to discriminate.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers, we've been striving to reduce separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be broken.
This separation has been reduced, increasingly and more, to such a day that it's less than one millimeter, the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so when the strong squeeze against the screen, they transfer its physical body to pixels.
Designers can map their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So, with this tool, you break the barriers.
But the two hands are still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the hands of hands?
In the discipline of Microsoft applied in Microsoft, along with my mentor Catholic Boliday, I redesigned the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect fingers and face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as to grab a book from a shelf.
You can honor the book and track lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that's below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are in the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is an Internet virtual developer.
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or translucent when the system understands your body's geometry.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch them and feel them?
What would a future look like that?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Remoke Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This spherical magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
Simplicity, what we did was the gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical and detectors.
And when we digitally program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physically and at the distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality of the time we wanted.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real, palpable experience that you can touch and feel . It's very powerful.
But what's most fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something, but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world.
We started talking about today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a girl for two years in Huntington, China, the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer to an athletes school with all expenses.
But my mother tiger said,``No . ''
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a road path to happiness: a safe, really radical work.
No matter whether the job I would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must start to train from very young to learn the features, so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the school director and the president of a radio program.
But no adult was grateful with the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much greater to train.
My dream will never be done.
feared, that during the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire.
And this was so unfair.
So I'm going to look for another voice.
Nobody else wanted to teach me? Okay.
It records the books.
[" Complete Obstacles"by Samuel [`` History of History"-- I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were banned in China, of course.
\" The Good Earth"is about Chinese family life.
And it's not convenient . I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but odd.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation:``Honor to your father and mother . ''
\" honor ,"I said,``It's so different, and much better than obey . ''
So it became my tool to come out of this conference trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my comparative reading habit.
A lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map was out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research camps as a comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contract, offer the academics a deeper understanding of a topic.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can treat people from Walter Islamic's``John Adams'``John Adams'``John Adams"who were involved in a same event, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the temptation are economic, political and spiritual.
For Buddha, they're all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
[" The path of China Tzu"] [`` The Time of May"Alan Gates) Instead of getting in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through translation I realized that``happiness"in Chinese literally means``fast joy ."Ha!
And``girlfriend"in Chinese, literally means``new mother . ''
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't feel lonely or powerless.
Having a waste dream really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a desperate dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always hitting them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychotherapy of psychotherapy.
I was a medical student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman called Alex.
Alex went into the first session using asteroids, and a liver cap, he threw on the couch of my office, took off the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so relieved.
My classmates had a signature like first customer.
And to me, I was able to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the story stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to move the head while we broke the solution.
\" The cliffs are the new 20s ,"Alex said, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, you home later, you have children later, even the death happens later.
For sale, like Alex, I had time.
But shortly later, my supervisor was introduced to press Alex to talk about her loving life.
I was resistant.
I said,``Of course, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, it's associated with a headache, but it's not like it's going to marry him . ''
And then my supervisor said,``No yet, but maybe you marry the next one.
Also, the best time to work in Alex's marriage is before it's married . ''
This is what psychologists call``Aha!"moment.
It was when I realized that the '30s are not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what was used, but this didn't make the 20th of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the 20th of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized, this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future releases everywhere.
There are 50 million cups in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the 20.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I want to see the veterans here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with sales, you love a veterinarian, you take your sleep down, I want to see . Okay . Amazing, the real ones matter.
This is not just my opinion . These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments``Aha!"which gives you a way to his life will have gone through when they're 30 and so many.
People from over 40, don't train in panic.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money you gain.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s, and it's reported for adulthood, which means that if there's something you want to change itself, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during its 20s than at any other moment in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at the age of 28, and things become complicated at 35.
The 20 are the moment to educate about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person that will become.
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development, and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the 20s are listening to.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of adulthood.
The researchers call the 20 an extended adolescence.
journalists are charged by ridiculous names to the tents as``Trigon"and``Christophers . ''
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial thing that's actually the decade of adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think it happens when you give a pain in your head and say,``You have another 10 years to start your life? ''
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition, and absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart 20s, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this:``I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count . I'm just killing time . ''
Or they say,``Everybody says that as you start a race before 30, everything will be okay . ''
But then it starts to sound something like this:``My 20 are for finishing and I still have nothing to show.
I had better rsum the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it starts to sound something like this:``My quotes during the 20 were like the chairs game . ''
They all run and fun, but then at some point around 30, it turned out the music, and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one that would stay stopped, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I was 30 . ''
Where are the tension here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but don't get wrong, risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s, there's a huge pressure to the tropics, and so many of us start a career, you'll choose a city, choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much shorter time period.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research they start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything in the '30s.
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
Do you realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of trials and streets look themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20s,``What was I doing? What was I thinking? ''
I want to change what the 20s are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said it would like to work in art or entertainment, but you couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a month.
As a cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend who showed more temperature than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, his previous life had been even harder.
He was often crying in our sessions, but then she stood himself when he said,``You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends . ''
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
He had just bought a new director of a director, and he had spent the whole morning with her many contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words``emergency case, please call...''
I was at the point of history when he saw me and said,``Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident?
Who's going to take care if I give me cancer? ''
At that time, I had a lot of work, and I won't say,``Me . ''
What Emma needed was not a therapy that was really worried.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex to just sit at me while I was the decisive decade of Emma going ahead.
So over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of his 20s, man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma that he would forget about that identity crisis, and he got identity capital.
For capital capital, I mean doing something that adds value to your person.
Do something that is an investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generating capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that interface, that company that you want to test.
I'm not describing exploration, I'm describing the exploration that I shouldn't tell, which by the way, is not exploration.
It's proportion.
I told Emma to explore jobs, and I made them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are surrounded.
The best friends are great to take you into the airport, but the 20s that come together with friends with similar minds are limited in how much they know, what they know, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from outside of its closest circle.
Now, new things come from what are called the weak friends friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the 20s have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half is not, and the weak ties are the way to color this group.
Half of the working jobs never published, then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a non-lethal job.
It's not cheating . It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but it does his friends.
This was true when I was growing, but as a tenth, Emma will soon choose his family, and when he has a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that the 30 is better age to feel head than the 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live in now or accuse you now when everyone in Facebook starts walking towards the altar is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have it, and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just making it work or killing time with whoever you are.
So what about Emma?
Well, we looked at that director, and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that he lived with.
And now, five years later, it's special in museums.
This married with a man who chose consciously.
He loves his new career, love his new family, and I sent a letter that said,``Now, emergency contact spaces are not big enough . ''
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with.
It's very easy to help.
The 20s are like airplanes coming out of the Los Angeles airport, which come out somewhere from the west.
Right before the takeoff, a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
Similarly, at 21 or 25, and even at 29, a good conversation, a good discovery, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading all the veterans you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have the privilege to tell you as Emma every day: The '30s are not the new 20, they'll watch their adult, they get identity capital, they use their weak ties, choose your family.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they did.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in a management consulting for a work that was even more demanding: the dozen.
I went to teach me mathematics to seventh grade students in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, applies tests and testing.
I give them tasks.
When the job came back, he calculated the grades.
What called me the attention was that the I.Q . wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance did not have any CAPTCHA scores.
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, secure, are difficult: proportion, decimal, the area of a parallel.
But these concepts are not impossible, and it was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard, and during time enough.
After several more years, I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the CIA, but what if you succeed in school and in life depends much more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios, and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the military West West Academy.
We tried to predict what chains would remain in the military training and who they will recover.
We went to the Yellowstone National contest, and we tried to predict what kids would move the most far possible in competition.
We study novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking us what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and those, who will be the most effective to improve the results of their students?
We partnered with private companies, asking, what of these marketers are they going to keep their jobs?
And who's going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, a feature was a feature as a major prediction of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good appearance, the physical health, and it wasn't the CIA.
It was determination.
determination is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to get to your future, day after day, not just a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it's a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination questionnaires, and then waited about more than a year to see those who graduate.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to graduate, even when I started them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized evidence, even security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just at West Point or at the National Development competition where the determination matters . It's also in school, especially for kids at risk of leaving it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the little thing that knows science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,``How do you develop determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a strict ethic?
How do I keep them motivated for the long term? ''
The most honest answer is, I don't know . What I do know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't follow with their commitments.
In fact, in our data, the common determination is not related or even relatively related to talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called``growth mindset . ''
This is a developed idea at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Dewey has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and grow in response to challenge, they are much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start all again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan as the daughter of a calculation, one of my most frightening memories is my mother showing the beauty, shape and figure of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a foreign, it seems as impenetrable as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can run this wall, so that whatever I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new, quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic would understand 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read transit signals, restaurant menus, understanding the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
People.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming in a frantic way,``Audience! I'm burning!"This symbol actually is original of the shape of the call, but I like to believe it's the other way . The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The gate symbol looks like a couple of doors from a singer in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's``follow . ''
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person would stretch their arms, this person is saying``I was this big . ''
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
It's a prisoner, such as Jon inside the whale.
A tree is a tree . Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a``idiot ."Easy to remember, because a parallel tree is quite idiot.
Remember fire?
Two fire fire, it's very hot.
Three games together, that's a lot of calls.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burn.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two sets together, prosperous.
Three together, those are flashes.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door . Put a table inside the door, is the gate of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Do you touch, I played somebody at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, escape, avoiding.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing.
Three women together, have careful care.
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radiologists will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn an eight-year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a fire mountain . It's a volcano.
We know Japan is the Earth's land.
This is a sun with the origin, because Japan is the east of China.
So a sun next to the origin, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese employers would destroy their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, exile has become going out.
A mouth that tells you how to come out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage . Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four, we saw the Oz magician together.
The movie dominated his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glass, of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial fantasy of child fantasy.
However, Oz's magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took over four years later with, interestingly, another film whose protections, a metal kid, and a hairy boy rescued to a dressed girl as the enemy guard.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the ocean of Oz.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that if Oz's magician was done today, the magician would say,``Dorothy, you're the Oz salvation as the prophecy predicted it . ''
You use magic shoes to defeat the computer-generated army of the brutal evil.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz's magician is that the most heroic, wise characters are women.
I began to notice this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
It's just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the supervision level had gone down . And so he was sliding in the room, and he was impressed as a mother leg with his cats behind, and I didn't think he understood what was going on, but unfortunately, it absorbs everything.
I wonder what I perceive.
Would they be value, perseverance and loyalty?
Would the sense that Luke is an army to defeat government?
So let's compare this with the Wizard magician in 1939.
How does Dorothy win his film?
It's making good migraines with everybody and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow Oz, okay? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital F, force in the movies for our children, and so little from yellow brick path?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it . It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the Life princess doesn't provide the right framework that had served me to navigate the world of adults that is blended . I think at the moment of the first kiss, I really expected that the credit to start appearing because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest has finished, I have girlfriend.
Why are you still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
movies are focused on defeat the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a warrior suit.
There are many exceptions, and they're defending the Disney princess to any of you.
But send a message to kids, even though they, kids, are not really their goal public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the patriarchy.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as Herecton and Kansas, but they don't stop being a war movie.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear in classic after classic, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who have a girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out brave.
I recommend it . It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie from a princess.
It's very good . Don't let that stop.
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of Beck.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not yet thrown roots and already spreads, but maybe we'll start a movement.
Alice Bick is a comic sketch, and in the middle of the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the evaluation of the movies they saw.
And it's very simple.
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the guy you like? Okay? Thank you . Thank you . Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens . I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, Argument.
Right? Rumors from Oscar, catalyst success, an idea of a consensus of what a Hollywood movie is.
Virtually, it doesn't happen.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in an embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostage crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this script, and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say,``Do you come to bed, honey? ''
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular movies, how many of them think they have female protagonists?
It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we have recently chosen for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a greater number than this is going to tell this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
Here's what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos, or pornography, are closely linked, but something wrong, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual farmers.
Who are those guys? What are they learning?
What do you don't have to learn?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our disposal as a poet of power, and we expect that to help, but I have to ask,``Is it power, is it going to protect them if, at the same time, active or passively, are we educating our children to keep their power?
I mean, I think Netflix's list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the assault.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character from Star Wars know what he responded?
Obama.
Bobby Kennedy and Glass.
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films who know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my son,``See and struggle alone and more stories where the job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, help other people improve and be better people, like the magician of Oz.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for them.
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love in the past and architecture.
And finally when I started studying Egypt, I realized that to see with my own eyes was not enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of a miles of length next to the Nile.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to do otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared.
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared, and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Internet, lost for thousands of years.
Isabel was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the Fab, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The elites have always known that IBM was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that build them, put inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous aluminum planning.
This area is enormous, it's about six by four miles.
Before, the Nile flows right next to the Isy side, and as it changed over time, he moved into the east and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a super-energy city in an extensive landscape?
I'll try to find it at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves.
So we use NASA topographic data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile flows.
But you can see more closely, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Isacra.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing show jobs; you can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the sample shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation.
Five meters down, under a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of cellular objects.
This means that in this possible location of Isabelle, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that are from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is stupid.
We also found a job of harm, cord, quartz and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop there.
This might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that's data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We don't find Ireland here, but we'll go back to the place in a nearby future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably he was written at Isabel 4,000 years ago.
And sharing knowledge is the biggest of all the vacation.
There's nothing like that on earth.
So it seems, TED was not founded in 1984, C.
And they made ideas happen in 1984 a lost city in a lost city, not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door.
I want you to pay attention to the door of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now visualize a group of obese nodes in bicycles.
They're competing in a business of bicycles, and they're going on to their entry door.
I need to see this really.
They're striped strong, they're sweating, they're jumping a lot.
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying around, wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in absurd places . They pass the door.
The lobby, the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light . The light shines over the God's monster.
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks.
You can feel your blue fur making them tickle in the nose.
You can smell the oats of oats, and you can see you're about to get on the mouth.
They go on the side, and you enter their living room.
So in the room, and making a maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Spears.
It's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on its center assignment, singing``Hip My More Time .".
Now let me get to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven comes to you Dorothy, the Malawi Man, the Space and the``The Wizard of Oz ,"grab out of your hands, jumping up to you.
Okay . Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the United States champions.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, hoping, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise supercomputer.
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different hygiene habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them once.
They memorize the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize the order of a narrative of narrows.
And I thought,``This is amazing . ''
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and she has one of the best trained memories.
I said,``Ed, when did you realize you were a wise? ''
Ed replied,``I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participated from this competition say they have normal memory.
\" We have trained us to make these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize their speeches, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was,``Wow . How did I haven't heard of this before? ''
We were standing outside of the competition room, and Ed, who's a wonderful and brilliant English, even though a little bit extraordinary, he said,``Josh, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Spears? ''
And I said,``What? No, why?
\" Because I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize order in a live Christmas deck, in national television.
That would test the world that anybody can do it . ''
And I said,``Well, I'm not British Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something right? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year not just training my memory, but also researching, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.U.
He's amazing, it's very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a memory problem; it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Peek . He was based on the role of Justine Hoffman in the movie``Rain Man . ''
We spent a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, memorize telephone books; it was central.
And when I go back, I read a number of treaties about writing memory, something more than 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Ancient and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned many really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having trained memory, discipline and grown was not a kind of weird thing as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide laboratories their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally, and I would say that they've changed us also cognitively.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of trained memory, discipline and growing is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so singular; there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College invited a group of memory champions, to the lab.
You wanted to know: Is it that it has brains in some way, structural or analyzed by the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the rest?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually, no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that they compared to.
When they put them in a MRI machine, they scanned their brains as they memorized numbers and faces and forms of snow coastal, found that in memory camps were lit up from the brain, different to others.
They actually used, or seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is running as an armed career where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, faster, and then the rest of the competitors should be put to the day.
This is my friend Ben Prison, three times a memory champion.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 barrels of messy nose who he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 413 random binary binary binary.
In half an hour . Yes.
And while there's a lot of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call``electrical coordination . ''
It illustrates with an elegant elegant, like the Bartellere paradox . [Back] says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word . I tell you,``Remember there's a man named Baker . ''
That's his appetite.
And then I ask them,``Remember, there's a bat . ''
And when I go back later, and I ask you,``Do you remember that word I told you about a while ago? ''
\" Remember what it was? ''
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is``cod .".
The same word, different ability to remember -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
With all the other memories you dance for their head.
But the word,``Baker"-- we know baker.
They use simple white hats.
They have flour in your hands.
They smell well when they go home to work.
We probably know some baker.
And when we looked at that word for the first time, we started putting a lot of association for them to easily fishing them at some previous moment.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data about 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece.
It's known as the palace of memory.
The story is like this: There was a poet called Simon who attended a banker.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring a DJ, he hired a poet.
He stood up, he got his memory poem, and he was laughing, and so soon he was, the room of the banker collapsed.
Let's killing them all.
But not only killed them all, but it destroyed the bodies by letting them irrelevant.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And they couldn't get into the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Similar, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed your eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, he could see where it was sitting every single invited.
I took the family's family taking them to where their loved ones were in between the rubble.
What Singapore warned at that moment is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it's that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for words of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If I asked you to get rid of the first 10 words of the story I just told you about Simon, it's very likely to make it very hard to do.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse front horse in your lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the map of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and to fold it from images with the things that you want to remember: the more crazy, delayed, funny, scarcing, station, is the more unlikely to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first memory treaties, Latin.
And how does it work?
So let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it a memory, the same way that you would have done it by Cicero if you'd invited TEDx , 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to imagine some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy, crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely inspiring competition.
And then you can imagine in your house, and you can see the monster of the Galapagos mounted on Mike Ed.
And that would remind you you want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind you that funny anecdote you want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember.
This is how romantic speakers memorize their speeches, not word for word, which is going to confuse them, but typical by typical.
In fact the term``typical ,"comes from the Greek Greek, which means``place . ''
It's a research of when people thought about the sentence and the rhetoric with this kind of space term.
The phrase``first ,"it would be like the first place in its memory palace.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got on that.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this subculture of competitive memorized.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a purely boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests . I mean, the exciting thing that happens is when someone moves the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get me in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of an old school announcement bought in a thumb market.
And I found that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I'd never expected it to be.
It was entertaining, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What's actually trying to do is better improve the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous, comics, provocative, inspiring, absurd and life, in the eye of mind.
I was quite hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of ears and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, because distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before . I had the idea that I could go into, in a kind of participatory journalism experiment.
And I thought this could be a good impact for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition, something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice power to memorize speeches, and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build paper sticks or memorize barrels of cards, to benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be an innate gift, but it's not the case.
The big memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we're deeply concentrated.
The memory palace -- these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even real shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They're a kind of deep process, a kind of complete attention that most of us don't just run around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things get memorable.
And if there's something that I want to leave you today, it's what E., the man who couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our current existence in the Blackberries or iPhone, not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walked to our side . Are we so honored that we don't even bother us to process deep?
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person that you remember remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we'll address just a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from Mr. Jersey, I was six years old and I lived there at my parents in a village called Lincolum, and this was my child bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And, between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave to the living room.
And there you all spent the time looking at the TV . So every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody saw me, and every time I was shower and I went back into a towel, everybody saw me.
And I was like this.
It was awkward, insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that balance, hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no area division, but of those visceral, emotional connections that we feel in the places we occupy.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I'm going to tell you:``power ,"`` stability"and``democracy . ''
And I know that you think that for based on a building , 2,500 years ago by Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a determination that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection; we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid planes, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build . Urban planners and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Liberia Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome; it has this round thing, columns, red brick, that let me go into this building: children, ownership values, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library ended up, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to gather and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are they so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the pendulum.
On one side is innovation; architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for today's life forms.
We drive, let's push and take so much, that we get away from people.
All black, this depressed . You think we feel very well, but we're dead inside because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and come back into those appreciated symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like transitions, so we start experimenting again; we make the pendulum back forward, again and again . So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well , 30 years ago we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called balance.
It's about the ant.
You can guess that.
Little windows, disgusting scale.
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
So we put the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know, and we update them.
We added nests and we added cake and we use new materials.
You love it.
We don't give up.
We take Chapter weapons and turn them into skyscrapers, which can be medieval castle made of glass.
The shapes were grateful, they won in audacity and colorful.
The dwarf became columns.
The risks grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasies.
Those fantasies could be the Mediterranean, the French, or the Italian.
You can possibly have a loaf of bread sticks.
This is what happens with power.
This is what happens to symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we prescribe memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated, and we start making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s, in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called democratic denominator.
We're describing historical symbols; we now have new design techniques with computer county, and we find new composition, some ways that are stars against other forms.
This is academic and drunk, and it's super impossible; you're totally excluded.
Normally, the dollar pendulum again in opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building is flooded.
It's the Bible of Bilbao, from Frank Gehry.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldillo said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when criticism, academic and public in general, were completely agreed to a building.
The New York Times called this miraculous construction.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2.5 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly everybody wanted one of those buildings: Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, September.
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media got vaccinated around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the world's major mayors.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium went with other star architects.
I went to Zazara and Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects in the new millennium in the new millennium, actually started to happen with all architecture, and digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is accelerated: you can take a ship, an airplane, you can be tourists.
Technology accelerates . You can see in the newspapers, in the TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before you know whether the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The brutality was not a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they hate them.
That's never going to happen . I think, because we're in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the concrete, steel or elevators, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the pendulum to media, it starts to get faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost simultaneously, and it's effectively distributed between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make almost instant symbols, with emotional charge, of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that went on.
This is the center of a village called Pine in Fire Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the end product, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community . That first summer, when people began to get and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these aren't just images of a building, it's the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes circuits with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those Liberians.
If that building was built today, we're going to go to the Internet for``new libraries . ''
We're going to be bombarded with examples of experimentation, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's ammunition.
ammunition that you can take to the Lego mayor, the people of leaders, and tell you that there is no single answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experiencing.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings, and you're no longer a desertification audience that doesn't accept something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't let you go through architecture.
That means that the dollar pendulum from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems that are facing society.
This is the end of architecture history, and it means that tomorrow buildings will be very different from today's buildings.
This means that a public space in the old city of Seva can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad history of red bricks with based on ideas of what should be a stadium.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because eventually we will be ready for the forms that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are tied to the capitals of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for yoga, or even you can marry in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming at the East River in New York, and raise half a million dollars from the community together, it's no longer a customer.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion pavilion, so muscular and fibrous as the animals you're going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more ecological, smarter and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides.
They find an architect, hold it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the smaller spaces, the local libraries, the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bathroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, star.
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does that in that great, typical way of the children in a year, burning, as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally precious.
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and chair, and it gives themselves those big and wet kisses.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of their friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it . And he made me think, when stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly disagree with our appearance?
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month , 10,000 people look at Google:``Am I ugly? ''
This is Facebook, it's 13 years old and lives in Denver.
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit scary, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him that it's ugly.
In between what his mom says to him and what his friends or friends say, you don't know who you believe.
So it makes a video of her, I posted it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a comment,``Am I nice or ugly? ''
Well, so far, Faiza has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so unpleasant, that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy, normal and current teenager, who receives these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going on to do this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, chatting, giving``I like ,"starting, sharing, sharing, this never ends up.
We've never been so connected before, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother said to me,``It's like there's a party in your bedroom every night . ''
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are implicit.
This environment, to be always connected, is addressing our children to supply the number of``I like it ,"they have and the kinds of comments they get.
There is no division between a online life and life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it's like.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what it's manipulated digitally.
What is the most disaster in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are they looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are cover from girls' news.
Earth models are still dominating our passports.
The tech technique is now a routine.
And trends like: there's telecommunication, there's typical, biomimicry, biomedical.
For those of you who know it, it means programming.
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the sports, the punch singers.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be very balanced individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see enough enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as contribute to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments, they avoid to participate in classrooms, because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspects.
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the temperature season, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough, you'll get a lower note to the average of your peers who don't worry about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, United States and China.
And it's irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to make it clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you're really.
The low self-esteem on its body is reducing academic performance.
And it's also damaging health.
The teenagers with a little bit of self-esteem do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more non-zero-sum diet than they can take them into food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them, and they're in greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more risky decisions, like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, drastic diets, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and non-invasive damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pressing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have higher rates of magnitude.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity be?
liberating this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms . The first is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs, without realizing, worse.
So, we need to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas . The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental, but facing this problem requires each of us that take the risks in the issue and be a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
By challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to talk about the contribution of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of their breasts, or to figure out that the determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as they look.
All of us can start doing it by putting responsibility for the kinds of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you got a mirror?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow up valuing all their people, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a pedestal.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out in the big screen because we're just going to create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they're never being seen by being who they are, or reaching what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who's in mind?
Your wife?
Her sister?
Do your daughter?
Your niece? Your friend?
It could just be the woman who is at two seats of distance . What would it mean for her if it was released from that autobiographical voice inside that it would be terrified by not having long legs, more thin mosquitos, a more flat belly, smaller feet?
What would it mean for her if we were supposed to do this and we would say,``We would say,``Well, the potential of that way? ''
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is catching us all.
But let's tell our kids the truth.
We teach that the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so the small courts of a year in today, become safe agents in safe change.
Let's do it.
On November 5 , 1990, a gentleman named Ellinter Last entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Mr. Kahaba, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
Now, we initially declared it innocent, but being prisoner by other charges, in the company of others, they started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Luckily, those plans are frustrated by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the BBC bomb in the World Trade Center could not avoid.
Later, I would be convicted by his participation on that attacker.
Ellinter Nashman is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer, with a lovely American mother, primary school teacher, between the two they made all possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, get to know.
By experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in every human group, there's always a little fraction of people who are so reserved to their convictions that they think that you have to use all the means possible for everybody to live as them.
A few months before the arrest, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend, he and some friends, had been going on on the roof training in Long Island, to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the California Pole, which, without knowing our group, was seen by the FBI.
When I got stuck, my father helped me hold the rifle in the shoulder, and I explained how to point the target to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot, I gave the little orange light on the goal, and, for a surprise of all, especially me, all the goal in the flames.
My uncle turned to the others, and in Arabic, he said,``Bang abuse . ''
From such a parent, such a child.
At all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they seemed so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted to put a coat with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking state of the North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and died another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them``Amazon ,"which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times . That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was time to catch me and go to another city.
As I was always, I was the new face of the class that was often a victim victim.
I was considered secret my identity to avoid being the white, but being the new of the class, silence and shelter, was enough ammunition.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I don't develop social skills, to say it gently . For growing under fantasy, I was not prepared for the real world.
They educate me to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators, like their race or their religion.
So how could I open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in my way of thinking, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a university program where I participated at the Journal National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a mass victim almost all my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various procedures.
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish.
I took several days to go to this detail, and I realized that there was no scaffolding between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to see the barrier that my whole life had made me believe that it was infrastructure.
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush Garden, a amusement park.
I met people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, all the homosexuals were bad influences.
Now, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most gentle and less critical ones I had seen in life.
By having a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat nice people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be gay, but I do know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the Daily Show.
Every night, Jon Stewart made me intellectually honest to my intolerance, and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my father figure at a time where I was desperately needed to need.
Occasionally, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremists, was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something to conserve in my heart forever, while I live.
She looked at me with somebody's eyes who have suffered enough with domestic endless and said,``I'm tired of hate . ''
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not Zach Gordon.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decide to go out and get in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, some day, who's trying to take violence, can hear my story and understand that there's a better path, that even though I was convicted to this violent and disturbing ideology, I didn't get me anymore.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism, and for their loved ones, by the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism speaking, against those meaningless acts, like rejection to my father's actions.
And with this simple, I'm showing me here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that's projected in your minds.
It's an amazing underground movie.
It's in 3D, and it has fresh sound of what you hear and see right now . But that's just the beginning.
Your film has steel, flavor and texture.
feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that are projected before your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice in your conscious thinking flow.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything.
This film is your awareness flow, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, you, you and you . .
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have a consciousness.
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films?
Why aren't we just robots that processing what we get to produce results without experiencing the internal movie?
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, you predict that vision.
psychology studied the objectively behavioral behavior, neuroscience studied the brain objectively, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then , 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pieter said,``It's time for science to embrace consciousness . ''
And since then, there was a real explosion, a flourishing of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic . It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of consciousness science in recent years was the pursuit of correlations, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something from this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kansas introduced a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you, saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness, questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Because I don't tackle the real central mystery of this matter: Why every physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective internal movie?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like embryonics, like the hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical supermarket are all cases of emergent behavior, how they operate the embraces, how hurricanes work, how they reproduce, adapt and metabolize living organisms . They're all questions about the objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon: how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess; they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the emergence, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a heart scientist.
I want a scientific theory of authority that works . For a long time, hitting my head against the wall, looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the conclusion, it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're stuck at this point.
We have a wonderful chain of explanations, great . We get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On one side, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of anomaly, something we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas . I think we need ideas that would seem crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the underlying subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain objective functions, the behaviors of the brain, and this is how everything needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionist consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
At the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental brick: space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that govern them, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties are not explained in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they're considered fundamental, and the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is alert.
In the 19th century, Maxwell discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental, fundamental concepts, space, time, mass, Newton's laws, and then I put the basic laws of electromagnetism, and I put electrical charge as a fundamental concept that these laws govern.
I think that's the situation in which we meet consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, charges, then by logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be political consciousness as something fundamental, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a science object.
It opens the road to scientifically handle it.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts: space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can put them in a memory.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find some fundamental laws that we can put them on a t-shirt.
We don't yet know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called pandemics:``bread"by all,``Pick"by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even microbes by Rob Knight, the elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or they think.
It's not that a photon can be full of anguish when you think,``Oh, always traveling at the speed of light . ''
I can never slow down and smell the pink . ''
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have any element of crude, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so crazy?
This comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the other ones.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems illogical, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to the physical process, is linked awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
complex information processing, like a human being, complex awareness.
Simple information processing, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, Ghana Tong, took this kind of theory and developed it regularly with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information in information, which measures the degree of information in a system.
And I suppose it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high fish degree, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half of information integration, equally significant, very important consciousness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the fish degree said.
Information level is lower, but it's not zero either.
In Tony's theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness: high degree of fish, high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that capitalism can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking explained,``Where does the fire leave? ''
Now, from psychiatric vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describes the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of addiction.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, the pandemic vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and you can have a pretty serious social consequence.
Some can be illogical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a vegetarian.
If you're a piano and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think I think, well, this tends to transform your visions, while what matters in ethical terms and moral consideration, is not so much of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha in the movie``Hey . ''
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of peaceful information, she has a processing of complicated information, integrated, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
So if this is right, you've got a lot of serious ethical problems about the ethic of smart computer systems and the ethics of stopping them.
Finally, you can ask for full collective awareness, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, as the audience at a TED Talk . Right now we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be serious.
So this piano vision, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second, that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait overnight.
But I think we'll finally go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I got together with my friends, I was fighting my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to name me for a community prize.
And my parents said,``Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't got anything ."And they were right.
I went to school, I had good notes . After school, I had a low profile on my mother's hair, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series``Bump The Valley"and``Damage's Creek . ''
Yes, I know . What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take disability out of the equation.
And years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school in Melbourne, just about 20 minutes in class 11 minutes, a guy raised his hand and said,``Hey, when would you give your speech? ''
I said,``What speech? ''
Well, I had been talking about the law of difficulty for good 20 minutes.
And he said,``You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about inspiring things in school? ''
\" Usually, in the act room . ''
And it was then when I realized: This kid had had experiences with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we're not . And it's not the fault of the guy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our machines.
We are not real people . We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking like what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for them to inspire you . Right? Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to tell you specifically.
I'm not here to inspire them.
I'm here to tell you that they have lied in relation to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is something wrong, Plastic, M capital.
It's a bad thing and living with a disability, makes you remarkable.
It's not bad, and it doesn't make it exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You can have seen images like this:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one:``Your excuse is invisible ."indeed.
Or this one,``Before I quit, intellectual! ''
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may have seen one, from the girl without hands drawing with a pencil sustained pen.
You may have seen a child who runs with port-in carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term porn deliberately, because they are a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we classify the disabled disabled people.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can look at them and think,``Well, by very bad it's my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person . ''
But what if you are that person?
I've lost the number of times that have been approached by strangers, wanting to express that they think I'm brave or an inspiration source, and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy to get up in the morning and remember my own name . And this is to cook.
These images, these images, they're going to match people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We're going to take some things out.
But the things we outweigh is not the things that you can think of.
It's not relative to our bodies.
I use the term``disabled people ,"deliberately because I subscribe to the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very close with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to kids of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to know the way we do, when you share those images?
When people say,``You're an inspiration source ,"it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of lie, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here by booking inspiration, and you think,``Oh God, star, aren't you sometimes inspired by something? ''
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learn that this is a great idea to use a little bit of barbecue, to collect the things that are falling to me, learn the ingenious tricks of how to load the cell phone battery on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but a world that's excluded and it makes us.
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude ,"the reason that it's lying is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a staircase has never done that it becomes a ramp.
Never . smiling to a television screen will not be able to appear the subtitles for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and inspiring a positive attitude to convert all those books into the braille.
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching``Bush the Valley Silence ,"doesn't consider anything about being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we're happy to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genetic achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where an 11-year-old child in a high school school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Discovery doesn't make us exceptional, but to question what you think about it, I know it does.
Thank you.
What have the augmented reality and professional football, with empathy?
And what is the average speed of a glass without charge?
Unfortunately, today, I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't wake up.
When people think about augmented reality, they think about``Minority Report ,"and in Tom Cruise putting their hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because it's augmented reality to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, is what I'm wearing: the Google Glass glasses.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google Glass are a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running through the game camp at 100 miles, blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels that a 110-year-old man, trying to get to us with all of their being.
I've been there, and I assure you that it's not nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass is using under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NFL practices, because the idea of emerging technology is a submarine rising on the surface . But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Klen: We go.
It's horrible to be labeled.
A moment . Let's take a little bit.
Ready?
Go!
Chris Klen: As you can see, it's a forecast of what is being caught in the football field, from the perspective of the keyboard.
You've realized that it needs people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
fields of field: Mice 54! mice! mice!
Blue 8, Blue 8! Go!
Chris Klen: This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the NFL.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and you've asked me on YouTube and Twitter,``You can see from the angle of a field market.
And from a corridor?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with Copernicus and Google Glass, how do we get out of full, how do we take it to the next level?
We take it at that level using something called October Rift, which is surely a lot of you know.
The Occupy Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing! No!
Oh my God! Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain burning for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we take a video from Adrian Peter crossing the line, leaving a keyboard with the arm before you run and make an anomaly? What will be the experience of a fan.
When can I be Jesus running around the waterfall, launching the bullet at the bottom of the network, or February doing a single seal in Windows?
What will be your experience when you leave a mountain to more than 100 miles as an Olympic skier?
Maybe you're increasing the paper sales for adults.
But this is not yet augmented.
It's just virtual reality, RM.
How do we get augmented reality, R?
We will reach up reality when the coaches, the monkeys and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think,``How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win games? ''
Because they always use technology to win.
They like winning . Give them money.
So, here's a brief set of technology in the NFL.
In 1965, the Palestinians of Baltimore put it down to their field muscle to play faster.
won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL put radio in the hull of the fields of fields and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, imagine that you're a player coming back to your group, and you see his next player shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing . -- you won't have to worry about forgetting a player.
or to memorize strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties, you take a coach.
And they don't want that.
But increasing reality is not just a manual strategy manual.
The augmented reality is also a way of collecting information and using it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner corner having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors and the accelerometer sensors, something that's already working.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will be able to send it.
The bad ones will have information overload.
This makes the good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your recruited, and the data analysis will stop being alone for nerds.
Who would have imagined it?
What would it be in the field?
Imagine you're the field director.
You get the balance and you go back.
You're looking for an open receptor . All of a sudden, a flashlight on the left side of your bombsight, you notice that a defense behind you is going to attack you . Usually, you wouldn't see it, but the L.A. system stuck you.
They move into the protection area.
Another flashlight, you have an open receptor.
You toss the bullet, but you're sleeping.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land . However, the receptor sees in its view a iron area that lights up and can modify the career.
It's approaching, and it caught the bullet, running and anatomy.
The public puzzle and fans have followed the player from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the party.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: Do we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus, like our usual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, to be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for the sports league.
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology worth a professor in the classroom trying to show a bully how your actions are from the perspective of the victim?
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how you live being pursued?
How much is it worth for a Harvard Hole or a Neil Degree Tony trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly and Krethward notes?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes up.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, depend, as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retire after 23 years of service in the Chicago patrol of California.
Most of those 23 years I've been able to paraphrase the South Side of Marine County, which includes the Goldman Gates Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, which is known globally by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and his inspirational architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also an imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The God Gates Bridge was open in 1973.
Joseph Street, a chief engineer who was commissioned to build the bridge, said that,``The bridge is practically proof of suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical or likely . ''
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been identified as such, such that the fall from him frees you all of your concerns and pain, and the water that's going on below cleaning your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a drop of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact broke the bones, some of which drill vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that don't, normally they get hit in the helpless water, and then they drowned.
I don't think that the ones that look at this method of suicide, they realize the death of the death that you will face.
This is the cable.
Except around two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are standing in before the life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at their darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man spoke with an officer completely contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the railing.
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who look at suicide, but the officials too.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veteran officials and psychologists train new officials.
This is Jason Garage.
I met it on July 22 last year when I got a call from a suicide subject sitting in the heart near the center.
I responded, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official from the Goldman Gates Bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here twice before New Jersey to try suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason, he asked us if we knew the story of the Pandora box.
Remember Greek mythology, Jeff created Pandora, and he sent her on Earth with a box, and he said,``Never, you never open that box . ''
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
They came out of pests, pieces, and all kinds of evil against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us,``What if you open the box, and there's no hope? ''
It stopped a few instincts, he leaned on the right, and it went.
This nice and smart guy from New Jersey had just taken the life.
I talked to Jason's parents that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was . .
The parents in Jason had been asked.
The spiritual damage of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved being suicide?
What would you say?
Do you know what to say?
In my experience, there's not only to talk, but you have to listen.
Listen to understanding.
You don't argue, blame, or tell the person you know how it feels, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection you need.
If you think somebody is suicide, you're not afraid to confront them and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is,``Other in similar circumstances have you thought about running their life -- have you had these thoughts? ''
confront the person in front of you can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to search: despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to improve, you're going to believe that there's nothing you can do about it -- recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady, and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost his son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
\" Hi, Kevin.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite numb, but I'm going to notice more moments to realize that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving Phoenix to San Francisco to see the game of 49 with his father on January 19.
I never got there.
He called Peace's police, and he reported it as disappeared that night.
At the next morning, two official officers came to my house and reported that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge at 17 o'clock in the afternoon.
Thank you very much for fighting that they can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a true mental illness?
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
GDP, the Bridge Golding Gates is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Viking . ''
I can't imagine the value that she needs to go to the bridge and turn the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 , 2005, I responded to a radio call for a substantial subject on the side of the bridge near the north tower.
I drove my motorcycle on the sidewalk and look at this man, Kevin Berlin, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, I crossed immediately, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next hour and the next half, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, happy.
\" This is a new start, a new life . ''
But I asked him,``What did it make you go back and give it to hope and life another opportunity? ''
And you know what he told me?
He said,``You heard me.
They let me talk and just listen . ''
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter of Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read them.
\" Dear Mr. Brown, nothing erase the events of March 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin's still with us.
So honestly, I think Kevin was crying for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly medication.
I adopted Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all of those inherited traits, but, thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
Simply in debt with you, Nigeria Berlin . ''
And at the end, she wrote,``PM . When I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you would figure out how the patient.
\" Oh, I do have to solve it! ''
Today, Kevin is a loving, active father of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and the hope that his story will inspire others.
Suicide is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing its own pain, stole the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most suicide people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think to hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually, this is only done in three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and support called suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three occasions.
And in the end of the end, I looked at me, and he said,``Kevin, sorry, but I have to go . ''
And I jumped.
Horrible, absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, yet, that the vast majority of people we get to contact on that bridge don't suicide.
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second they left on the side, they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect Mario with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and each of us should be striving to do.
The suicide can be prevented.
There's aid . There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question is, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, I'm not alone.
When I became a model, I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had.
My outside finally agreed with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think, you know, you do it.
But the October October, I discovered that, just, I'm starting.
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value to release, to get rid of the limitations tax by the color of skin or by the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
And I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was registered as``child"by birth because of the appearance of my genitals.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me,``Why do you always take that t-shirt in your head? ''
I said,``Mom, it's my hair . I'm a girl . ''
I knew how to join me.
The gender has always considered an inevitable fact, but now we know that it's really more complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never had to share my story, not because I thought I'm being wrong, but why the world treats those of us who want to liberate.
Every day I appreciate to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asia culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess, a goddess of the girls.
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines who celebrate these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was 15, I met this woman called TED.
It's the principal of a transgender beauty contest.
That night she asked me,``Why have you not been involved in the beauty competition? ''
He told me that if I was involved, she would be running out of the expense of the institution and the costume, and that night, he won in a bathroom suit, he won in a gallery suit, and he was third for over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of the beauty remarkable.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was a breath of beauty of breast women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the shocks, especially when we traveled to the reporters of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom, I had moved to San Francisco, called me, and I told me that they passed my request of the green card that could go to the United States.
I was resistant.
I told my mother,``Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty queen . ''
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said,``You know if you move to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of gender? ''
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two``and"to my name.
She also accompanied me when I operated in Thailand at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of Thailand's most rural cities do the most prestigious, sophisticated, safe surgery.
At the time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before they change the name and gender.
So, in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name``F"of female gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or power to get a swallow, but to me it was the license to live, to feel worthy.
As soon as my fears were mining.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think about this woman of Mom Network.
A young woman in New York who willingly lived his truth, but he disappeared, he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality in which they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global glass by the Voluntee Day of the transgender.
I'm in this stage thanks to a long story of people I fight and stood up to injustice.
This is Marshall P Johnson and Sylvia Riverside.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, exposing me, so that there is no longer 20 of November.
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you . Kathryn Schulz: Wow, a quick question.
George Rock: Sure . You'll see, first, thank you with all my blessings.
And my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been attending young women, who I've originally experienced, and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it . I took the phone, I called my mom and said,``Mommy, can you call this woman? ''
Sometimes it worked, others . It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all get a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that non-lethal allocation, and there should be a space that allowed people to self-assemble, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement is starting compared to gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understood.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you . Very nice . GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malawi started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007, and when their efforts were shocked in 2011, when you put the National Prize of peace, it was very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but I'm now her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at human history, women's history is the story of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, their birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not welcome, not by his father, not by her mother.
The neighborhood comes, it gives its conditions to mother and no happiness to the father.
And a mother is really overwhelmed for having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, it's shocked, and with the hope of a child, when he shines his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only is the mother suffering, but the daughter, the newborn daughter, when it grows, suffers as well.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, you stay at home and the school admitted to his siblings.
Until 12 years old, in a way, it has a good life.
It can be fun.
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it's 13 years old, you get it out of his house without a male stroke.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called his father's honor and his brothers and his family, and if you translate the code of that honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this is an honor code, not only the life of a girl, also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, he sacrifice the joy of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a norm of more patriarchal societies called obesity.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very smooth.
It's the criteria.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be silent and accept the decisions of his father and mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like it or if you marry it with an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be uninterrupted.
If you marry it very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, they call it delight.
And what happens in the end?
In words of a poet:``The marry, they love it, and then it gives birth to more children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, he puts the same obesity to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
He loved brothers and sisters, when Malawi was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored.
And so much before I was born, I thought about his name, and he was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi, and he called my daughter like this.
But when I looked at me, they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I brought a line of my name, and I wrote,``Malawi . ''
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years ago, I admitted it in my school.
So you might wonder, why should I mention a girl's administration in a school?
Yes, I should mention.
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a child's life.
Inspiring in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
An admission to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I've got five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when I turned the Canadian view, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the apples of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and the dignity of my daughter.
I encouraged him to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
I encourage it to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to instill them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malawi.
I've made all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for emancipation.
I taught my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called superhand.
They wanted brothers and sisters, we fought more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called telecommunications.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools lost.
Girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced, the beaten girls and the killed singers.
They were suffering millions, but a few spoke, and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and pull when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, Malawi stood up and stood up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, he offered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and he talked in every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spreads as a climate around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and October nine of October , 2012, shot it on the head.
It was a fatal day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was discussing between life and death, I whispered my ear to my wife,``Should I blame me for what happened to my daughter, your daughter? ''
And I immediately said,``Please don't blame you.
They defend the fair cause.
They put your life in play for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter will inspire you and join you.
They were both on the right path and God protect it . ''
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When Malawi was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that spread through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
I used to tell you,``I'm fine with my tortured smile and the excitement in my face.
I'll get good . Please don't worry . ''
It was a consumption for us, and I was comfort.
Side brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist at the hardest times, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
He cried when he didn't end his task.
He fights his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me,``What about my tutor that's made so audacious to Malawi, so brave and experienced? ''
I say, you don't ask me what I did.
Ask about what I didn't do.
I don't cut their wings and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you.
I was operating from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am an engineer.
And I want to tell you I've recently joined me to the Montessori group of Google, where I've had a currency to my charge -- the visualization of Google X, but all the work I'm talking about today about brain science, I did before joining Google or my job there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you're subjected to a brain operation.
You're still as smart or not?
Not being like that, can you be smart?
After neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, I would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix mix, and try to get them, to continue with life.
More than once I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of experimental soul, so I decided to experience to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't exist a clear map that's saying it in a debt.
I started testing with different mixes, and I was surprised to see how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my self-esteem, my sense of who I was, my behavior, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case: for a few months, I tried double doses and chemical chemicals for a man of 20s, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always curious, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and -- of course, many times in the past, I've met several kinds like this, or maybe some attacked versions.
It turns out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
In fact, I was trying, an insecure, to fix a problem that had in front of, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through, since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to achieve, when I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, was to regain my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think about it almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point: how do you get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want? New ideas, and to recreate situations.
These kinds of thoughts is not new.
philosophers like humor, Descartes and Hobbes see things in similar ways.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are people who question this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how minds work . For me, it's simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and invention.
So after several years, I managed to find the right point, and I've got lots of great mental, really vivid, highly sophisticated, strangely structured.
Now, I'm working on how to make these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what happens if a movie director could be able to use your imagination just to steer the world that has in the front?
Or if a musician could extract your head's music?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can be shared at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional MRI, to represent the brain . Here you can see the brain scan done by Jordan geese and their colleagues from Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as it imagined, looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by restoring the contents of the central column on the left . You see that difference is almost nuts.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same picture is almost nuts.
Now, let me share another experiment . This is the lab of Jack Galapago in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into recognized visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, people were showing hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were exploring their brains to create a huge range of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then, I showed a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while it was a new scan.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scan decided to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computers of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us burning.
We're right about doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same map.
This was done with the brain scanning systems of higher available resolution today, and their resolution became a thousand times in the last few years.
We now need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is opening the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer me for that.
Many of you are providing new design techniques for images, even me . counting with the recent MRI result, first we have to ask ourselves, this technology will be the end of the road?
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, not increase by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than bigger magnets, we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements, like making a spiritual.
And why does this care?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most recent advances in return from ingenious and brilliant solutions in coding and decoding, in the transmitter and receptor frequency receptors in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic magnetic field, we use magnetic patterns that are built to the frequencies of the FM radio.
So, by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the Facebook radio frequency processing, we can actually increase information that you can extract in a single scan.
Also, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
Using MRI, we should be able to measure not just the fluid of organized blood, but the of the hormones and neuroscientists that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity . This is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly by thinking?
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of the human thinking without filters?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more options than opening this door.
Anyway, choose a year, would happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have guns.
His closet may be to tell some person for the first time you love it or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you've been attracted in life.
It's a difficult conversation, and although our topics can vary tremendously, the experience of having lived and out of that closet is something universal.
It's scary, and we don't like it, and it has to happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side Walmart Side, a restaurant in the city, and he was there, I had to go through several phases of the local military intensity: I didn't run my armpits, to quote the letters of Saint Die France as a litany.
And I'm going to be aware of the Holocaust of my short pants, and I had encouraged my head recently, I would ask myself a little kid,``Hey, are you kid or girl? ''
And it would appear an awkward silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a random drop.
The father was administered by the newspaper, and the mother would launch a cold looking at his son.
But I would say nothing, and I would get inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, again.
\" Are you a girl or a girl? ''
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and he was about to get into the female affairs at the table, and I had the Betty Friedman quote.
Gloria Steinem's quote.
Even a fragment of the Vagina Monologues that I would show.
And then I breathe up and I went down the look and my back, and my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at me what is not a challenge for a feminist drill, just a girl with a question:``Are you a kid or a girl? ''
So I would breathe back, and I put them close near her, and I said,``Hey, I know this is a confusing thing.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw a boy clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I am more than the kind of girl of a comfortable pajamas . ''
And that little girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said,``My favorite pajamas is purple and it has a fish.
Can you give me a park, please? ''
And that was it, just``Oh, OK, you're a girl.
What about the park I asked? ''
It was the easiest difficult conversation of all I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the park and I, both, we were honest with each other.
Just like many of us, I've lived in some closet in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be a rainbow.
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color the walls are.
You only know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different than you or you or you.
Surely, I'll give you 100 reasons why to come out of my closet was harder to get out of your own, but this is the thing: The hard thing is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has been in a broken bank is harder to tell you that it's been fooled?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your five-year-old than you're going to divorce?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classification of what's hard to us about what's hard for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our closet, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they may make it safe, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, no matter what their walls are made, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and shoes of high heels.
It wasn't the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child to go into coffee.
I was frozen by fear, curled in a corner of my dark closet putting my gay fat, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers with which I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't launch that grain, you will kill you.
One of my more memorable landscapes was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I did my honor rubber workers, my black dress and my heel, walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents' friends were, people who met me years ago.
And after I speak a moment, one of the women shouted,``I love Nathan Lane! ''
And the battle of the gay story had started.
\" Hey, do you ever be in the Castro? ''
\" Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San Francisco . ''
\" Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fabulous . ''
\" Oh, you know my Atheny Atlantic?
It's very good, and he has never talked about having girlfriend . ''
\" Oh, what's your favorite TV program?
Our favorite program? Will and Grace.
And you know who loves? Jack.
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman, discussing, but in waiting to dramatically show her support, to make me know that he was on my side, finally said,``Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirts . ''
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all of the grandmothers.
Sure, it could have been easy to indicate where they felt missing.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were straightforward.
And what else can you ask someone, but will you be able to make them?
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you get.
That's how hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I've come out with.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Pantheon's girl.
Now, please look at this through gay perspective, but they understand that what it involves out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic . .
Take the armor . Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have an armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be genuine, others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be straight.
If you know they're gay, give it.
If you say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly -- leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They're never sorry about that.
And some of you can get out safe wounded, sorry for what they've done, but they never apologize about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark closet pushing a grenade, you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Boulder . Enjoy the candle.
Intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Ed Discourness that``The question of if a machine can think about it is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . ''
When Ernest Dick wrote this, he did it as a criticism to the IT pioneers like Alan Turing.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
We go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race, which you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look incredibly long, so a billion years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about it, it doesn't have any concept about Earth intelligence, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, up to a certain time in time, the asteroids that develop the surface of a small planet just stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I analyzed a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology, for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be financially adjusted for intelligence development, and in particular, for developing universal states that maximize the diversity of future possible.
Finally, in robotic motion planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different topics and putting them together, I asked, for a number of years, is there a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we could extract from all these different topics?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is . What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of an E = a month for the intelligence I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a force, F, it acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the options open, with a T force, with the diversity of accessible future, yes, to an impending future time, tau.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be trapped.
Intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping open choices.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
It predicts the level of human intelligence?
It predicts artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research research have suggested that the universes that produce more messy, or``entropy ,"for their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that tendency cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence involves a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with long-term entropy production, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropher, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find inside.
So surprisingly, entropy could spend multiple animal intelligence tests, playing games of humans, and even winning money by buying actions, all of it without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of anthropology in action.
Just like a foot human without falling, here we see entropy balancing automatically a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave entropy a goal.
He simply decided to balance the pole.
This ability of balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This capacity of tools of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate from the opposite of a rope at the same time to release food, and here we see that entropy can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Entrephing is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game for itself, illuminating its potential for the game.
So here we see anthropology orchestras new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and successfully keeps the network well connected.
This same capacity of network orchestras also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see anthropology organizing the routes of a ship fleet, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand globally its scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Similarly, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see entropy, spontaneously discover and execute a strategy of company, selling in a simulated series of action negotiation, successfully increasing the assets under its exponential management.
This risk of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Wikipedia: What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behaviors such as tool use, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony.
Let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term, the Romantic play, the concept of the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion.
The machines would take against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we have all the concept of cyber rebellion to reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent, and then molecules and trying to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all the potential future is a much more fundamental principle than intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise to take control, rather than the reverse.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
I'm often asked,``How do you look for targets, and you wake up from this kind of framework? ''
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call home.
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
NASA's Melockedologist mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, which points out that the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the underlying intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance of them and their mother star.
Now, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocks like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their suns.
At once, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this terms of potentially livable worlds, our own planet is declining under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest record.
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused global scale has rapidly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist of climate, no astronomer.
But I study the skill of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the immortal sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to Earth, the more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly unknown planet and the planets that we know better: the ones of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world demonstrated by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly, it's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our Rovers like``Curiosity"track their surface in pursuit of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit, like the MRI mission, take samples of the Martian atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its ability.
The private companies now offer not just short space flights, but also the tempting possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these Martian images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with cutting-edge ideas and pioneers, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that still remain to colonize, really external places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth, the air is fresh and oxygen reported by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for Mars colonization and other drag planets with a big and sad shadow: the implication and the belief of some of Mars's to wait there to save us from this authenticity that we know is truly livable, the Earth.
For a lot that I like internal exploration, I am deep disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say Mars will be there to save humanity, it's like figuring out that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of the truth will have a place later in the wild boats . Thank you.
But targets for planetary exploration and Earth preservation don't control.
No, it's actually faces of the same coin: the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world, they look like aliens.
They're just found closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile hostile areas, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment: the Fermi paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked: realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life existence so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider living between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that drive this development.
It's arrogant to think that only international colonization will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and the interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to protect Mars's hostile environments for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve stability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I stayed my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly, I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all fine closed.
I thought about calling a warrior, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a warrior could take a long time to get, and he made cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to pass night, because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I practiced my suitcase and my suitcase.
It was expensive, but I'm sure that it wasn't more expensive than a carbon in the middle, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I would run right.
I'm a professor of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
Courage release that increases heart rate, model levels of adrenaline and global thinking.
And when I got to the front show in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking me, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in the place, that prevent bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, they minimize the probability of being a total catastrophe.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't spell.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Khan, won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called prospective retrospective.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the professor.
Everybody knows what the dessert is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the teacher, as Danny explained, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, next to you, try to figure out what can do to prevent things happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things that we can do in the form of a teacher.
Some of them are evident, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will make a place for the things that are easily lost.
This sounds from common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis, based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where it's the good, where the fish are, where the friends are living and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that's going on in the London taxi.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the solid sense of the squirrels, and you still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing car keys, reading glasses and passports.
So at home, they make a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For their passport, a particular crate.
For their reading glasses, a particular net.
If you make a place, and you're creative with it, your things will always be there when you look for it.
What about travel?
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card, license of driving, passport, poison it by email to themselves so they're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or steal, this can facilitate the substitution.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
The cortisol is toxic and international thinking.
So part of the promising practice is recognizing that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved self, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is written as a forecast for all of the medical decisions, and in fact for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from the fact that a rational assessment of facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says,``I've received the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high . ''
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, brain spill.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says,``I'd like to get a drug to help you reduce the cholesterol, a station . ''
And maybe you've heard about the statistics, and you know that it's one of the most prescribed drugs in the world today . It's probably likely that you know people who take them.
So you think,``Yes, you get the aesthetics! ''
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the U.N., the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the U.N.?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join a surgery in any medical procedure before it will help a person.
And should you think, what kind of statistical statistics is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not get me something if I didn't help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not guilt of the doctor, and if it's guilty of someone, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of GPHIN that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely prescribed statue, which you think is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of cynical researchers Jerry Gorgeon and Pamela Harvard, confirmed independently by Bloomberg.
I myself explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, cerebral spill or another adverse event.
Now you might think,``Well, one probability in 300 of my cholesterol.
Why not, doctor? Give the recipe anyway . ''
But then you should ask for a more statistic, and it is,``Talk about the side effects ."Yes?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: delivered muscle pain and articulate pain, but now they think,``Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking medicine . ''
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think about how you can do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug that you will help you.
I don't say they should or not take the statue.
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the first informed consent.
We have access to access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to be quite typical.
For the surgery that it's done in men over 50, extraction of the prostate for cancer, the number needs to treat is 49.
That is , 49 surgeries for one person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or the distributed dysfunction, ordinary income, straight landscape, fecal unconscious.
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just to last a year or two.
So the idea of the promise is to think before the questions that you can plan to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have why to manufacture all this in the act.
And you also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, do you want a shorter life free, or a longer life that could be a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases cortical under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, you don't need the digestive system, or the library or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react with fast . You might be the lunch of lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those stress moments is rational logic thinking, like Danny Kahn and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to train us to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all flawed.
We're all going to fail every once.
The idea is to think about the future how those failures could be, to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent bad things happen in the first place.
When I was running the snow night in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed me a combination of combination alongside the door, with a key to the gate door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't ordered, and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not really organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: piano,``P"is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a``P"in the score, you need to play more gently.
Two' ' even more soft.
Four' ' extremely soft.
This is my drawing of a play tree ,"there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of``P"can be, you will never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence: a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the randomness, a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came in during the 1800s, and over the course of time, it's mixed with local signs, and the language is developed that we now know as Atlanta.
So it's got a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf . And they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
Sound are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, customs, behaviors and rules without questioning them.
So how do you understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my loudspeakers and they amplify sound.
Learning and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond.
So I've learned, for example ...
\" Don't shake the door! ''
\" Don't make a lot noise at eating the potato potato bag! ''
\" Don't mistakes, and when you're eating, I would make sure not to throw the covers on the dish . ''
This is all called sound tag.
Maybe I think about the sound tag than the average person does it.
I'm super surveillance of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of sound, which is about to come next.
From there, this drawing.
Toxic, by deciding.
TBP, to continue.
TB, by announced.
You can see that the landscape doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle holes and blobs.
In the deaf culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for``penalty"in the L.A. .
A typical picture has five lines.
However, to me, to make the self with my thumb that is not natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I was working as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries, and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend, and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was an auditory.
Now the sound has entered my art territory.
It's going to me more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound property and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it, and I decided to leave it.
I started to create a new job body.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control: social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was oblivious, it was something from a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to bend me and my artistic work, or I could get involved.
I chose that I would get involved.
There's a massive culture around language talking.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to society eyes, it's like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as equal and become my voice.
And so I'm able to be relevant in current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with a lot of different Internet performers.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wouldn't continue with this practice, I feel that I could get away in the forgotten and not have any social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium, deep in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and AIDS.
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in Atlanta.
The two are very space and highly modular, which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning as much of the signals as sound.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so they understand the best how AIDS works.
So, imagine a piano.
The L.A. is divided into many different grammar parameters.
If you run a different parameters for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the body's movement, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it's just a keyboard at a time.
However, the USDA is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in AIDS.
If only a keyboard would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone, timbre and volume.
In L.A., by using these different grammar parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal``shock on that . ''
This is the sign of that.
I'm seeing you.
Look at it.
Oh, they caught me.
Oh.
What are you looking at?
Ah, enough!
And so I got to think, and if I look at AIDS through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeated it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of``day ,"the sun comes out and put it.
This is``all day . ''
If you repeat it and reduce the speed, it visually looks like a musical piece.
Day.
I feel that the same thing can say``all night . ''
\" All night . ''
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of nights:``Night ,"`` during the night ,"`` overnight ."`` all night . ''
I feel that the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed at AIDS and how distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hero . It's a hand, two traces . It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is in the back.
So the first example is``a long time ago . ''
Then,``past"--``Uganda to ,"and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time,``There was once . ''
\" Common Time"is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per capita.
However, when I see the word``common time ,"I automatically think of``at the same time . ''
See MR: Oh, right hand, E: left hand.
We have the landscape through the head and the chest.
( Face: MR, fall fall] [A] [unclear] [unclear] [unclear] ) I'm going to show you a shape of the hand called``flat limb . ''
Can you do it with you?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do so much in the head as the chest, something like``common time"or``at the same time . ''
Yes, very good.
That means``love"in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the language languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this . Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means``colonization"in the L.A. .
Now, the third . Please give me again.
And again.
It's``lighting"at the randomness.
We're going to do the three together.
\" Andrown ,"`` colonization"and``illumination . ''
Good work.
Notice how the three signs are very similar . They all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meanings.
It's incredible to see how AIDS is alive and prosperous, just like music.
But today, we live in a very authoritarian world.
And only because the L.A. doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start question what the social value defines and allow the L.A. to develop its own value, no sound.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn AOL, not that you have to hear music.
A restaurant is a rich treasure, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Dean Kahrine: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said to me,``You can build everything, but then you have to clean it . ''
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble bubble or an ignorance bubble, and I should say, because adults lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
As I get older, I learned that adults are also instructive and that they're not very good to clean each other.
Time, I'm now an adult and teaching citizen and invention at Harvard Kong School.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizen, we clean the beaches, and not, it's not drink alcohol, and if it is, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something spooky.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study under the microscope, and we classify them and we collect this information into a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So along with my students, with age six to 15, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this job of work with altitude altitude so that the kids very low can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are feeling great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just collect information.
By the use of a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- the children are really excited with robots.
We then quickly created what we call a prototype.
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes we end before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras, and we assemble it in a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on the board process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We documented this invention step-by-step on a website called``International ,"with the hope that somebody's best even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're pushing, they're trying to solve it immediately.
[ I can investigate my local problem] But my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and they got stuck with this image.
A child, maybe under 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in Sundarements, the largest mangrove rainforest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised, because this is the water that drink, it's the water where they're bathe, the water where you fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and oil also are brown color, and when everything gets mixed, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called the spectacular, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a space that can be used through all kinds of substances that produce different spectrum, which can help identify what's in the water.
We tagged this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help their children remotely.
And I can investigate a problem at a distance for me, forced me to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they have a number of giant waves, called tsunami, and those tsunami had been destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear nuclear central.
And today, according to the reports, an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has pollution traces by 2,000.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it's safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fukushima every year from accident and research independently with other scientists, land, river, and this time we wanted to take kids.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow it.
But every night we informed the control center -- here's the use of different masks.
It might seem like they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with productivity all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data, that day, and we talked about what we were going to do after, the strategies, the relative, etc.
And to do this, we created a reductional map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pictures to represent real-time data from radioactivity, and we spray water to simulate the rain.
And we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was filtered from the top of the mountain to the virtual system and planted in the ocean.
It was an appropriate estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear central to date.
We run up to a mile from the nuclear central, and with the aid of the area of the area, we were collecting sediments from the sea milk with a sediment tracking as we invented and build.
Here we see a progression: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong, and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical, basically, can be built almost there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children' dreams can come true with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
Students: acceleration! acceleration!
Couple Harriet: We asked things like, can we invent the future of renewable energy?
For example.
Or, can we help in the mobility of advanced age population transforming its standard wheelchair chairs into new electric vehicles?
Plastic, oil and radioactivity are terrible legacy, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect kids from the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, scientific citizens, creators, superstars, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and the people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes, two radically opposite design cultures.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic, the other organic.
One is imported about the environment, the other one creates.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the brutal marble, he saw a figure that was fighting for being free.
The 5,000 was only Michelangelo tools.
But the living ones are not linked.
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we take all the information for each cell to work and to replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturers of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, including the imagination of trained designers and architects to think about their objects as architecture of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find ambulance of homosexual material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with diabetes pores.
The skin skins are more thick with little pores.
You act mainly as a filter, the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin: there's no parts, there's no assembly.
It's a system that gradually vary its functionality through the variation of elasticity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my divided world vision, the double personality of every designer and architect to work today between the fifth and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, shows in the two screens after me.
My job, at its simplest level, is trying to unite these two visions of the world, remote from the assembly and going into growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't this possible 10 or five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they're confusing four disciplines that offer access to access to the tools we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large-scale, such as this robotic arm with a 24-year-old scope with a vertical base that someday not very far to print entire buildings, and graphs to nanotechnology made of genetically modified microorganisms that shine in darkness.
Here we've reinvented the ice, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is only unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt, and this was for a Paris fashion parade with Iran van Heroes, and it's like a second skin made from one piece, recorded in the continents, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and fake 3D face in between the cells . I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid and soft materials in the 20th microns resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CD scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and the synthetic instruments, allowing products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at a time, comfortable, and also absorbed sound.
Professor Carter, my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire us, and when we designed this pattern of irregular surface, it becomes sustainability.
We print this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in stiffness, opportunity and color, corresponds to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addiction of another material or another assembly, but moving continuously and dramatically property.
But is the ideal nature?
Isn't there parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible, and one of them was left, and it came to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she related,``In the third day of creation, God sends the Earth to grow a fruit tree charged . ''
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruits.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land was growing trees with branches, crust, workshops and flowers.
The land created a world made from parts.
I often wonder,``What would design be if the objects were made from one piece?
Will we come back to a better state of creation? ''
So we're looking for the biblical material, the kind of material tree material with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant biopsy on the planet is called the cup, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms as shrimp, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
We think that if we can synchronize their properties, we could generate malware structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal sea.
Walking chemical concentrations, we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, it was built a system with multiple controlled extraction nozzles.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material three feet long , 100 percent recyclable.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural form to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain physical microorganisms that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we took the bacteria genetically designed to capture rapidly carbon carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without a mesh, and if you wake even more, to windows.
A fruits tree charged.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, laying in the sea, feeding marine life, and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The adjustment for our next exploration uses the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the planetary travel.
To do that, we need to dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic table, we did our own table of elements: new forms of life created computing, made in additive form and augmented in biological ways.
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid cliff, only instead of translating precious metals, new biological functions are synthesized within very small channels.
This field is called micro-machine.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, two microorganisms combined.
The first one is California.
He lives in our oceans and the sweet water tanks.
And the second, E. coli, the bacteria that was in the human intestine.
One convert light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract, to help you to flow these bacteria and to alter their way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, moving the properties of the material according to desired functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we designed more transparent channels.
This portable digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another , 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin intestine.
And here it is, as a TED primary, our first portable physiology, brilliant liquid channels with life within the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said,``We are passionate creatures, only half is made . ''
What if the design would provide the other half?
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, repair the damaged tissue and hold our bodies?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
Now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
It's also known that nature doesn't do this.
It grows . It adds with sophistication.
This call of the worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home in which it's metabolism.
It's not additive manufacturing at this level of sophistication.
It does it by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations.
An act like structure, the other one is glue or matrix, putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first comes up in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then starts to be a copy of compression.
tension and compression, the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
With the end of understanding how this complex process works, we paste a small magnet to the head of a silk worm, to the sky.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the chicken worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch, not within a box, we realized it's going to take a flat cocoon and still memorized.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, is directly transmitted by the environment.
They often get rid of the silk worms to death inside their cocoons, their silk is rid and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these templates could shape the raw silk without a single cocoon.
They're saving healthy, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a military robot making silk plants, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms to the darker and cold areas, so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or open, to block the rays of light and heat, distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the organisms.
We asked 6,000 silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after we feed four weeks, they were prepared to glad with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the scaffolding, and as they danced, they would criticize, they were approved, they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
As the biological silk of the swollen silk silk, they give all this pavilion.
And in a little more than two weeks or three weeks , 6,000 silk worms take 65,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
Poles, after the equation, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra pavilions in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk ice through a robotic arm, the other empty light.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to join these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
So here's a new age of design, a new age of creation, that brings us from an inspired design in nature to a nature inspired in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we're running nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever asked them,``What do you want to be more? ''
If you had to remember what age they were when they first asked them?
They can show you with your fingers.
Three . Five . Five . Five . Five.
Now raise your hand if the question``What do you want to be? ''
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question,``What do you want to be more? ''
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had too many.
In school, I liked the English, the materials and the art and develop websites, and also, I played the guitar in a punish band called Telescope Frustra.
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to send me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in something else, something completely different, and I'm immersed in it, and I let me absorb and I'm like,``Yes! I've found it ,"and then again, this point where I start bored.
And finally, I want to leave you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because it wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and I'm going to get bored.
Another reason why I caused so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me, because I didn't define anything.
I was worried to be afraid to compromise, or being dispersed, or about to support or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have planned to me.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it: they learned from culture.
We're asked,``What do you want to be more? ''
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you're happy to.
It's considered an naive question to provide nice answers in children like``being astronaut"or``being a dancer"or``I want to be pirate . ''
So, you know, they're the display of Hansen here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in various forms, P, high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point,``What do you want to be more? ''
It's going to be the cute exercise before what makes us sleep.
Why?
Although this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they could be.
In fact, it's just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though they're well intentional, you might laugh and say,``Oh, what nice, but you can't be an artist of violence and psychologist.
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Children, and he is an artist of rape and photon.
And this Amy Ng, a magazine publisher, a colleague, entrepreneur, professor and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of central life is very idealistic in our culture.
It's this idea of the destination or the true vocation, the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who isn't connected in this way?
What if there are many different topics that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a multiplicity.
A swarm is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a computer for this.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that drive the same idea, as a scholar, rent.
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sue refers to us as``scanners . ''
They use any term that you like or invent one itself.
It seems to me as a species of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see multiplying as limitation or application that you have to beat.
But what I've learned with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths as being this way.
Here are three multiple superpowers.
One: ideas of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and create something new in the intersection.
Sue Hong and Rachel Bingo expressed their shared interests in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, at the foundation Museum.
Mexico is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
Sue and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his eclectic mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
There's the new ideas from there.
And the multiply, with all their background, can access a lot of these intersection points.
The second underground superpower is fast learning.
When we multiply them on something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being beginners, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort zones.
Many skills are universal to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we pursue, so we rarely start from zero.
Norway dunes is a full-time journey and independent writer.
As a pianist pianist, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest mechanism known.
Before becoming writer, Norway was financial planning.
He had to learn the most early sales mechanics when he started his practices, and this ability helps him write compelling launches for publishers.
It rarely is a loss of time to devote to what you're drawn to, even if you finally abandon it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have predicted.
The third underground superpower is adaptability . It is the ability to transform anything that is needed in a given situation.
Abe Cargetto is sometimes director of videos, others, web pages, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles, depending on the needs of his clients.
The Faso Company magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and unpredictable that it's the individuals and organizations that can mimic to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that will really thrive.
Testing of ideas, rapid learning and adaptability: three skills where multiply are very adept, and three skills that you could lose if they're prepared to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest to encourage multiplying people to be themselves.
We have complex, multi-million problems right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are composed from a specialist and a startling cluster.
The specialist can dive deep and put in a practice, and the crowd offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to deal with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the multiply in large part are encouraged to simply be more like their specialized partners.
Once I said this, if there's one thing you get from this talk, I hope it's this: reconstructed with the wiring wiring, whatever.
If you're a heart specialist, then, especially all the media.
That's where you will give the best.
But for the multiply in the room, including those who have just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes, I tell them,``Reconstructed with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those rabbits.
They explore the intersections.
embracing our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multiply, the world needs us!
Thank you.
In 2001, a woman called Turka was led to a psychiatrist in French.
It was delivered, and he couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alaska.
Alaska didn't know how to help Australia, but he was flying by her until, unfortunately, he passed in 1906.
After his death, Alexanders did an autopsy and found strange plates and airplanes in the Australia brain, a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you've been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than Alaska gave him 144 years ago.
Alaska was Dr. Alexanders altruistic.
And Australia determines, the first patient in getting a diagnosis we call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 2001, medicine has moved a lot.
antibiotics and vaccines have been discovered to protect us from infection, a lot of treatments for cancer, antibodies for the HIV, states for snails and much more.
But it has been programmed in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
The Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the probability of their years to happen with Alzheimer's or help to take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
Already in the U.S. alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease, and its cost provides a five times increase in 2050, as the generation of the baby boomers aging.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't prevent, cure or even slow its development.
We understand the Alzheimer's less than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than at Alzheimer despite the fact that it costs us more the Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause: lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should: The Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 144 years, everybody, even scientists, confusing Alzheimer's disease.
We think it's going to be safe in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only a picture of a healthy aging brain in comparison with an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to discovering a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduced reduces the expectancy of life, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the Russia brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are sticky.
And when it folds right, these sticky dots end inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes protein molecules stick each other, forming groups that can form large plates and sheep.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happens to block is complex, how to trigger a bomb.
You could do anything.
Now, cutting the others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expect the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, geneticists, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process . Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms, and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 144 years of waiting, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to tell you that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we try it, we can verify it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have taken more research and exercise pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to see cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, hidden victims, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too dangerous to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
The Alzheimer's not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients as Australia, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They're talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times column column, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing myself a night last night.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are tube to make 36 more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of examples.
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28: When was the last time you cry before another person?
And just?
As you move forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30: -- I really like -- Tell your partner what he's going from him or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled on this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the gossip that two of the participants had been married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also intrigued.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love.
However, we fell in love, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the column to the spinal Love Modern a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably wonder: Do you still go together?
And the reason I think you're questioning this is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And of this question, it's just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, it was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my friends of Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views.
And that made a good attention load in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave, I had no idea.
The article published online at night, and already the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And Sunday, they've already called me the Tom Show and the North York America.
In a month, the article received over eight million visits, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with sincerity on its own loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked the same question: Do you still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick quest on my email with the phrase,``Do you still follow together? ''
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed to the stage,``Hey Mandela where is your boyfriend? ''
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the treatment.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to be comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have made life itself.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for Valentine Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse before all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both made a public emergence together.
I did the television interviews, and they rescued the photos of the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the institutional icons of the parking process, a range that I didn't feel at the absolute qualified.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: I mean, if it was able to produce losing love, not just an adventure, but real love, depressing love.
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, especially, people ask the wrong question.
How do you know whether we would follow together or not, and also tell you?
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for to foster interpersonal focus between university students, using what Aron called openness, sustainably sustained, progressive and reciprocal openness.
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after doing it . Several wounded studies also used the Ambiration rapid protocol of Iran as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the police and community members, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideologies.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student approached me and said,``I tried the study and it didn't work.
He seemed puzzling for it.
And I said, you mean that you love the person with who you did?
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said,``But did you get better friends? ''
Did you feel that they did get to know better after testing the study?
The puzzle.
So, it worked ,"I said . ''
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled on the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was practically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I moved in science.
I research everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could in a certain way dig the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just researched for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought that if I was stuck with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love . I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm looking for.
But I can also see more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I can reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee, not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but that it will continue to be loved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There can be a form in some way to mitigate something from the implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because to love it makes us feel wonderfully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story you ask, is it still together?
And his content with an answer of whether or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like,``How do you decide who you deserve your love and who isn't? ''
How do we stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know when to cut and distance?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably takes a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what they mean to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's this one -- a year ago, a stranger and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But in love is not the same thing that remains in love.
It's the easy part.
So at the end of my paper writing, love doesn't happen.
We stay in love because we take the choice of being.
And I'm sorry a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that I knew that choice.
I didn't consider how many times we would have to make that decision, and how many times you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before whether he will always choose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, friendly and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in America.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth I don't really believe.
And what I'm looking for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the ultimate happy ending in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that actually didn't write.
But what I have instead is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
And I was raised by some lines in the mountain full mountain, and I was in a way.
something that really affected me, something that really affected me, but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I'll find a dollar bill, a feather and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanoid humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's because there I am , 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a given moment I was in Hawaii -- I like to go out of an exhibition and make it surfing and all those weird things -- and I was making a colleague for my mother.
And I took a dictionary, and I took all the pages, and I made a kind of square cell to the agenda Agnes Martin, the resin covered and a bee was trapped.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite was happening: somehow it looked like the size, as if you look at the text with a magnifying glass.
So I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow the strokes, draw the same thing around a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
First, bottles -- that you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the resin layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go to Silicon.
It was great, man.
At some point I'm interested in the human form, natural size sculptures with the drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I die.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the resin.
So, I did this for years, and my artwork with something very big, I call``tropics . ''
For``tribe ,"I was largely inspired in``The Garden of Delicary"by Himalay Boston, which is a painting in the Museum of the meadow in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well,``traditional"-- explaining this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and the locust.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this analog mesh infrastructure where they hide.
This is where the creatures with animal heads are headed to the Pharaoh, ready to suicide in mass by running in the ocean.
The ocean is composed from thousands of elements.
This is a bird attached attached to a sacred.
Billy Graham is in the sea; the horizon of the World Bank's performance, the reflection of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, a kind of a journalist.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it's coming out of oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of the other hand.
Their hands are like balance, and it looks like a mythological self that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a kind of a traditional aspect.
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which you spit.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a nose, like a bird peak, and you spit clouds from this tube.
It also has a 50 feet long, a snake tail attached to the tropics.
Anyway, his tail comes up in a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in an ocean ocean balloon made from terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
Very previously, it takes me to my last project.
I'm in two projects: One is called psychologists.
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material whether it's encyclopedia or dictionaries or magazines.
But each act acts as a kind of file in ways of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they're together, they divide.
And you can walk between them . It's taking years.
Each one is basically a microscope pollution that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head; there's the chest, you can go into the entrance.
I'm going to be angry by the rest of the body: there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or not, or whatever it has, a kind of a planet.
It's a quick break of these works because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body park in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue.
There's a little stream scene inside the ribcage.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, as the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box . It's called pioneer Worms.
Within this box, there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio emitter, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spread all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We manage the box, and all the people in the middle of it chocolates each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you redefine who is and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very much out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness, and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
Take a vacuum.
But so that this pill has an effect on pain, first through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and most effective system, so that any strong drug effect in the body.
The disadvantage, however, is that by bringing it any medication, it's dilute.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take antiretroviral drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the CEO.
But they are also known by their adverse side effects, most negative, because in time they're taking in the blood stream, they dilute, and worse even for the time they're going to get to their destination, which is where it's more important: in the HIV warehouse.
These are regions of the body like lymph nodes, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is infinite and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream of patients that are attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the big problem of the HIV treatment with current drugs, which is a lifelong treatment of life.
One day, I sat down and I thought,``Could we make treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of the drug of drugs? ''
As a scientific expert in lasers, the answer was in front of me: the lasers, of course.
If you use it in dentistry, for the care care and the diabetes surgery, you can use for anything imaginable, including international transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best wonder,``How is that possible? ''
We send a little laser lightning beam on the cellular membrane, while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before I even realized, the hole is completely repaired.
We're currently testing this live technology or in petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
\" How is that possible?"you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an instrument that distributes the drug, releases it directly at the site of infection, while laser is used again to keep cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem much of the moment.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah . A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV researchers -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied with non-lethal armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to understand better to these generative agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation.
I do fieldwork, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No.
It's now a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 216 peace agreements between 1975 and 2011 , 1960 were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we even need to engage them or give them into any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and politics are not related.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to defeat them, without a global vision.
Today's armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the Heill Liberia, known by his violent confront against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980, Heroculg has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Hamas Palestinian, known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza France since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking.
They set up a complex communication machine: radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the IMF magazine, printed in English and published to recruit.
armed groups also invest in a complex negative fundraising, but by profitable businesses -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else, they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they put in a professional training program or microbes.
Heroinanisted offers all these services and more.
armed groups also try to conquer the population to offer something that the state doesn't provide: security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan disabled by war or even the beginning of the ISIS ascent, can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But generally, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in Palestinians can't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They grow because they fill gaps left by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are, less we can categorize them as something counterintuitive to a state.
How do you call a group like Herocketing?
They dominate part of a territory, they manage all their functions, collect garbage, manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is ISIS?
The lines are described.
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids, and the weaker the states are, like in the Middle East, the more they are, and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to contrast these groups to have to invest more not military tools.
filling that gap of governance has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and consider peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we will understand better what incentives to offer the transition of violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace or stability.
To achieve these targets, we need long-term investments to fill that security gap, to fill that governance of governance that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are glasses, but I fear that accepting openly the``feminist"tag would be unfair for the feminist.
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I get stuck as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article, and a book called``The Bad feminist ,"and then in the interviews, people started calling me the bad feminist.
So, what started as a personal joke to myself and a deliberate cause, has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth, and at the age of 20, I had strange ideas about the feminist, these furry women, angry with the men and they hated sex, as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people when I was trying to be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was an accusation, a taboo and unpleasant word.
They label me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is that too, with high self-esteem, and it's dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of being.
To me, certain claims are installation: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same supply for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want it, free of harassment or violence.
We have right to use an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for legislative control or evangelical doctrines.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to be aware of our other identities.
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, and gender expression, religion and sexuality, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to take these differences and how they affect us, in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evident, but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are lots of things that make a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear a pop-up music for all volume.
Although the letter degraded to women and profoundly offended, classic Shaker's``Salt Shop"is incredible.
\" Make it reality with your wet t-shirt.
Stop, give it, move it until he hurts the shell! ''
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely mortified by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all that I don't want to do, including -- all the domestic tasks, but also kill insects, garbage receptor, lawns care and handling maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It's enjoying fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see``The Back ,"and romantic comedy comedy, and I have absorbed fantasies of the fairy stories that make reality.
Some of my crimes are more disappointed.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband's hair, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is made in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they choose.
We solve this problem.
I reject conventional feminism that has ignored or historically deflect the needs of women in color, workers, gay and transgendered, for white women, heterosexual, middle-class, middle class.
Listen, if that's good feminism, I'm a very bad feminist.
It also happens: as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists in a pedestal.
We hope that they beat perfection.
When we're disappointed, we removed them with a lot of taste from the same pediatrician where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster; I already have to be dependent on that pedestal before they try to get there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and sector leaders, they're afraid of being tagged as feminist.
They're afraid to stand up and say,``Yes, I'm feminist ,"by fear of what that tag means, for fear of not being able to meet with a little bit of realistic expectations.
Let's take an example to Beijing, or as I call it, La Diagram.
In the last few years, it's a declared feminist.
In the Video Museum of 2014, in MTV, I acted in front of the word``feminist"of three feet tall.
It was a magnificent show, to see this star star embracing the feminism and making women know and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud.
Last time, cultural critics started international debates if Babbage was or not precisely feminist.
They slaughtered their feminism, rather than simply believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We come from the feminist of the feminist, because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so commonly so much.
We go far beyond the sensible and constructive criticism, to design the feminism of any woman, to destroy it until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our imperfections to accountability, going to action and being a little bit more courageous.
If I hear degrading music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we demand change effectively affecting their gains.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have its music to be so pigmented?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions are justify, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and our responsibility.
I think about my nieces, three and four years.
These are two magnificent, determined and brilliant girls, and also very brave . I want you to grow in a world.
Where they're appreciated by the strong creatures they are.
I think about them, all of a sudden, the best option is seen as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as a sport, and it turns out the Game of Thrones.
We can change radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than as decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as books.
In any case, men, especially white men can say,``No, I'm not going to publish in your journal, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate to make decisions . ''
I'm not going to work with you until your publication, or your organization is more inclusive with a broader range of people . ''
Those of us who are underpried but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also refuse to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision-making.
Because we are not any other people . Without these efforts, without adopt these positions, our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in the directors and products of film and music, CEOs, legislators, people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim with your feminism, good, bad, or whatever.
The last line of my book``Bad Feminist ,"says,``Would be a bad feminist not to be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it, especially, because it's my voice stolen, and the feminism helped me back.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids folded me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I came back to writing.
I was in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script and the feminism, I also discovered that if it was a bit brave, another woman could hear and see me, and realizing that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I support the subjective reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little bit brave, when you need such a value.
Right after Christmas last year , 125 children in California had measles for having visited Disneyland or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Dubai.
One of the tragic things of this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system, is one of the most highly preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century, but many of the children involved in the Disney outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly worse: autism.
But a moment, wasn't the article that sparked the police on autism and vaccines and distributed and marked by being a fraud by the British Medical Journal?
Don't you think most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a stupidity?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and the pediatrician that I had heard about it, they create all their professional lives without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed just three or four children per 10,000.
But then, in the 1990s, numbers started shooting.
funds of fundraising, like autism Autonomous Spain, are routinely referring to autism as an epidemic, as if they could tell you from another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center of Disease Disease Center, what's happening, they tend to be based on phrases like``value diagnostic criteria"and``better detection of cases"to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't really dissipate the fears of a young mother who looks in the face of his two-year-old son, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and the cautious of science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what the autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Leo Kennedy, from the Johns Hopkins Hospital . in 1994, Kennedy published a paper that described 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds, they would join people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces, but they were prey of the panic by often like when you didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of patients treated in their clinic, Kansas speculated that autism is very rare.
In the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as he collected references of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because the Korean criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, I would take that diagnosis to children with convulsions, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He once got paid that he had become nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to his computer for being autistic without giving them an autism diagnosis.
Kennedy was a smart man, but part of his theories were not closed.
It classified autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, have kept carefully in a fridge that doesn't shock.
At the same time, though, Kansa noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are going to be clustered in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before it was two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said,``Beethoven . ''
But Kanzi had a bad opinion of these skills, adding things like kids were simply recording what they had heard their parents, desperate for winning their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
It wasn't until the 1970s that the researchers began to test the theory of Kansas that autism was weird.
Lord Windows, the cognitive psychologist of London, thought that the theory of the nerve mothers in Kansas was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and affordable people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Susie.
Long and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susie without support services, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Norway and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism of autism in the general population.
They had a suburb of London called Cambridge to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the Kennedy model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others were rooted in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the genealogy of the reality.
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful and standard squares, as Judith said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Kong monolithic model would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one have ever noticed these kids before?
But then Lord found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year in the article of Kanitura, and then forgot, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kennedy knew about this article of competition, but he avoided dramatically to mention him in his own work.
There wasn't even a translation to English, but luckily, Lord's husband spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger, who runs an integrated clinic with an international school in the 1930s . .
The Asperger ideas for the teaching of children with learning differences were even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic, they started with music exercise classes, and kids followed their games in the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger described it as a political disability of life that requires compassion of support and adaptive spaces during the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger called them their little teachers, and it was decided to help develop methods of education that were especially suitable for them.
So, fundamentally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that had a amazing variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in archives known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and the distracted teacher.
He was beyond even until he said, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
Long and Judith found that Kanzi was wrong in autism that autism was inherently, so the parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Association of psychiatry to expand the criteria of the diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called``autistic spectrum . ''
In the end of the '90s and early '90s, their changes went into sight, replace the limited model of Kansas by a broad and inclusive Asperger.
These changes don't fall in broken dry.
And coincidentally, when Lord and Judith worked between baselines to reform these criteria, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out``Rain Man"in 1988, just a small circle, running by experts knew what autism was, but after the inability of Justine Hoffman, like Ray Babylon and the recognition of``Rain Man"with four awards of Academy, pediatrician, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials of using to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection to that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of``Rain Man ,"changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism consciousness.
The number of diagnostics began to rise, just like Lord and Judith predicted, actually hoped that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally got the support and the services that were deserved.
So Andrew Walker came to blame the vaccines for increase in diagnosis, a simple, powerful, and seductive history, as bad as Kanitura's theory that autism was safe.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, autistic is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve the new medical advances, and the term``neuroscience"to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, it doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily disruptive, obviously social, and it suffers from an attention deficit to details.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, which believed that``cure"for the most acceptable aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Rosie Zach once said,``We need all the hands in covered to create the boat of humanity . ''
As we browse towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
